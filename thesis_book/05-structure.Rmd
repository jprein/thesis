# Structure of This Dissertation {#structure .unnumbered}

This dissertation is part of an overarching, ongoing project led by Prof. Dr. Manuel Bohn (Leuphana University LÃ¼neburg) and Prof. Dr. Daniel Haun (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig). The project aims to create a new task battery for social cognition that will capture individual differences in children from diverse communities. The present thesis details the steps that have already been taken in this endeavor: During my time as a doctoral candidate, we have designed, implemented, and validated the first task of the battery, focusing on the fundamental social-cognitive ability of gaze following.

The present dissertation takes a comprehensive approach to developing the new gaze following paradigm, addressing it both from a theoretical and a methodological perspective. The first part of the [Introduction](#introduction) will focus on the psychological construct(s) underlying gaze following: I will describe the importance of human's social cognition and its milestones during child development. I will continue to elaborate on the construct of gaze following and its developmental milestones. I will end both these sections by considering studies that focus on individual differences and, subsequently, studies conducted cross-culturally. The second part of the [Introduction](#introduction) will focus on the methodological considerations for constructing a new task (battery). I will establish the need for individual differences- and cross-cultural research perspectives, examine existing social cognition measures with regards to this identified need, and propose a potential way forward for measures of social-cognitive development.

The next chapter on the [General Approach](#approach) of this dissertation will describe the aims of the four included publications. I will outline the methodological decisions we made while developing the new gaze following task.

In the [General Discussion](#discussion), I will summarize the findings of the four included studies and highlight their theoretical and methodological contributions to developmental psychology. I will discuss their limitations and provide an outlook for future studies in social cognition, focusing on individual differences and cross-cultural research.
