This task battery aims to capture individual differences in children from diverse communities. The present thesis describes the steps that have already been undertaken in this endeavor: during my time as a doctoral candidate, we have designed, implemented, and validated the first task of the battery. We have decided to focus the first task on one of the most fundamental social-cognitive abilities: gaze following. The present dissertation seeks to approach the development of our new gaze following paradigm from two sides: from a contentual and a methodological perspective. The first part will focus on the psychological construct(s) underlying gaze following: I will describe the encompassing term of social cognition and its milestones during child development. I will continue to elaborate on the construct of gaze following, its current state of research and remaining open questions. Within both of these sections, I will consider existing studies that focus on individual differences and subsequently, studies that were conducted cross-culturally. The second part will focus on the methodological considerations for constructing a new task battery. I will examine existing social cognition measures, identify common challenges and shortcomings, and establish the need for an individual differences- and cross-cultural perspective. The remaining chapters will focus on our approach to develop a new gaze following measure that tackles these recognized methodological challenges. I will summarize our study findings, discuss their limitations and provide an outlook for future studies in social cognition, focusing on individual differences and cross-cultural research. 5.2 Social Cognition What makes us uniquely human? Roughly 90 percent of our DNA matches that of cats (Pontius et al., 2007), and even close to 99 percent matches our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (Waterson et al., 2005). Consequently, we share several key features with each other. For example, our eyes, ears, and nose are designed to sensorily perceive the surroundings, and our neocortex processes this information and performs higher-order brain functions like spatial reasoning and motor commands. These features characterize all mammals. And yet, the majority of the earth’s surface gets populated and exploited by mainly one mammal: the homo sapiens. That it is humans who dominate the globe to such a degree (and even domesticate other mammals) is estonishing given the fact that there are many examples in which the animal kingdom far exceeds humans in their abilities. Cheetahs run with up to 120 km/h in speed, and Peregrine falcons reach over 380 km/h when diving for prey. Bats and dolphins use echolocation to navigate in complete darkness. Ocean Sunfish have extraordinary reproductive abilities and can lay up to 300 million eggs at once. The Greenland Shark can live as long as 400 years. So many other species are faster, produce more offspring, and live longer than humans, so which abilities brought humans to their ecological success? One aspect that is often highlighted is our ability to engage in social interactions and communicate with others. Humans have been described as “ultra-social primates” (Grossmann, 2022, p. 1): we form social bonds (Bowlby, 1958), live (mostly) cooperatively (Tomasello, 2020), exchange information and learn through observing others (Csibra &amp; Gergely, 2009). By relying on these strategies, knowledge and skills could be passed on from generation to generation — which could not have possibly been acquired by one single individual (Henrich, 2015). A seminal paper by Herrmann et al. (2007) tested the hypothesis that humans. They administered a cognitive battery with 16 different tasks to chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2.5-year-old human infants. Indeed, the researchers found that all three groups showed similar cognitive abilities within the physical world (space, quantities, causality), while human infants outperformed the chimpanzees and orangutans when it came to the social world (social learning, communication, Theory of Mind). This study clearly underlines humans’ remarkable abilities in the social realm, which might explain why so many researchers focus on this domain: A quick search on the APA PsycNet (on June 25, 2024, at 17:00 CET) revealed 28,594 results for the search term “social cognition”, while only 3,095 results appeared for “spatial cognition” and 95 appeared for “physical cognition”. 5.2.1 Terminology Before going deeper into the developmental literature on social cognition, let us clarify the term: What is social cognition? Interestingly, there is not one agreed-upon definition accepted by most psychologists. Rather, social cognition is and cynical tongues might say that there are as many definitions of social cognition as there are research articles on it. As Ostrom put it in the Foreword of the Handbook of Social Cognition: “I regard single-sentence definitions of social cognition to be slightly offensive […]. It would be more accurate to say that my preferred definition is the entire Handbook of Social Cognition, both this and the first edition combined.” (Ostrom, 1994, p. vii). Indeed, researchers have argued that the non-specific and heterogeneous vocabulary hinders empirical and theoretical advancement: sometimes, a single concept is described by several different labels (convergence of meaning), while other concepts share the same label but refer to different constructs (divergence of meaning) (Quesque et al., 2024; Quesque &amp; Rossetti, 2020). To get a clearer grasp on what developmental psychologists understand under the term social cognition, we conducted a short expert survey at the beginning of my Ph.D. (in Autumn/Winter 2020). We distributed an online questionnaire via personal contacts and emailing lists (e.g. cogdevsoc mailing list) to researchers broadly working in cognitive, comparative, cross-cultural and/or developmental psychology. Out of the 100 experts that completed the survey, more than half held a professorship, and the majority focused on basic research with children. First, we asked experts to define social cognition as a psychological construct. Exactly one third of the sample (33%, n = 33) chose a definition by Glynn &amp; Watkiss (2016): “Social cognition is the process by which actors, at individual or collective levels, decode and encode their social world, using mental models, knowledge structures and cultural understandings to process information, extract meaning and determine appropriate action.” (p. 1). The next two most frequently chosen definitions focused similarly on the information processing aspects in environments with other agents (“[…] encompasses all the information-processing mechanisms that underlie how people capture, process, store, and apply information about others to navigate social situations” (Decety, 2020, p. ix); “[…] is concerned with the study of the thought processes, both implicit and explicit, through which humans attain understanding of self, others, and their environment” (Moskowitz, 2013, p. 1)). In the next step, we asked experts to name which dimensions they mentioned most often when discussing or writing about social cognition. The dimensions that were chosen by more than half of the experts were beliefs, knowledge, perspective-taking and intentions. Finally, we compiled a list of 21 social-cognitive abilities and asked experts to rate the likelihood that children of the same age would vary to perform these abilities. The experts assumed that children varied mostly in whether they manipulate emotions, deceive others, simulate others’ reasoning processes, take another’s perspective, and understand the subjectivity of knowledge states. Abilities that were assumed to vary the least between children of the same age were recognizing agents and following gaze. It appeared that experts assumed variation in many social-cognitive abilities and judged the more room for individual differences, the more complex a given social-cognitive ability. Please note that more information on the expert survey can be found in Appendix 11. distinction theory of mind vs social cognition needed? ToM Abkürzung einführen 5.2.2 Developmental milestones Importantly, human infants do not come into the world already possessing all these social-cognitive abilities (Tomasello, 2020). Much of the developmental psychology research today focuses on how children acquire the social-cognitive abilities needed to become full members of our society. developmental milestones in social cognition anreißen 5.2.3 Individual Differences Many decades of research in social cognition have taught us much about developmental milestones and at which average children possess certain social-cognitive abilities (for a review, see Rakoczy, 2022). For example, we have learned that children are around four to five year of age when they understand that other agents can have false beliefs that differ from the child’s own belief and from reality (Wellman et al., 2001). Anyone who has ever interacted with children of a similar age must have noticed that they can still differ in their abilities: some children might be faster in learning how to walk, while others might be quicker in learning how to talk. Individual differences describe the features in which agents vary (“traits or other characteristics by which individuals may be distinguished from one another”, (Association, n.d.a)). Inter-individual differences focus on the variability between children, while intra-individual differences focus on the variability within the same child. Asendorpf (1992) have argued that inter-individual differences are often interpreted as trait-like characteristics (e.g. personality) that are more or less stable over time, while intra-individual differences might capture state-like characteristics (e.g. motivation) or development within a given construct. The present thesis and the associated publications focus on inter-individual differences, often abbreviated to individual differences. A prominent framework that could explain differences between individuals is Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory of cognitive development (L. Vygotsky, 1962; L. S. Vygotsky, 1978, 1987). This theory emphasizes the role of social interaction in children’s cognitive development and as such, learning as a social process. In other words, it is assumed that social interaction shapes social cognition. In order to empirically test if social interaction shapes social cognition, we need to study children’s daily environments and cognitive abilities on the individual level. Studies focussing on individual differences aim to measure variation between children in a given social-cognitive ability and, potentially, study the co-development of certain cognitive abilities or link this variation to internal and external factors that influence its development. As such, individual differences studies act as a powerful tool to build and test developmental theories and the structure of social cognition (Happé et al., 2017). Additionally, individual differences studies are needed to design (clinical or educational) intervention programs. Capturing change before and after an intervention helps to evaluate its efficacy. also for modeling, understanding underlying processes? Examples include studies conducted with twins (Hughes et al., 2005; Ronald et al., 2006). example from comparative work: some researchers focus on what chimps in average do, others focus on the very end of the distribution: what are they capable of? cross-cultural variation: not only average from small samples 5.2.4 Cross-cultural research 5.3 Gaze following 5.3.1 Terminology 5.3.2 Developmental milestones 5.3.3 Individual differences 5.3.4 Cross-cultural research 5.3.5 Research gaps 5.4 Methodological Considerations 5.4.1 Terminology In the context of this work, the terms variability, variation and variance need further explanation. According to the APA Dictionary of Psychology, the definitions of variability and variation greatly resemble each other (variability: “1. the quality of being subject to change or variation in behavior or emotion, 2. the degree to which members of a group or population differ from each other, as measured by statistics such as the range, standard deviation, and variance” (Association, n.d.d); variation: “1. the existence of qualitative differences in form, structure, behavior, and physiology among the individuals of a population, whether due to heredity or to environment. Both artificial selection and natural selection operate on variations among organisms, but only genetic variation is transmitted to offspring. 2. in statistics, the degree of variance or dispersion of values that is obtained for a specific variable” (Association, n.d.f)). Both definitions focus on differences between individuals that can be applied to the behavioral level. As in most of the developmental literature, the terms variability and variation will be used interchangeably in this work. As the definitions of variability and variation indicate, the term variance denotes a statistical measure for the degree to which group members differ from one another. It describes the dispersion of a distribution by calculating how far the values of a sample spread out from their average value. Consequently, a smaller variance means less differences between individuals in a given sample (a measure of the spread, or dispersion, of scores within a sample or population, whereby a small variance indicates highly similar scores, all close to the sample mean, and a large variance indicates more scores at a greater distance from the mean and possibly spread over a larger range”, (Association, n.d.e)). Validity concerns the truthfulness of a measure or the degree to which a measure captures what it is designed to measure conceptually (“1. the characteristic of being founded on truth, accuracy, fact, or law. 2. the degree to which empirical evidence and theoretical rationales support the adequacy and appropriateness of conclusions drawn from some form of assessment […]”, (Association, n.d.c)). There are several different types of validity. In the context of this work, we focus on convergent validity (i.e., the degree to which two measures that should be theoretically related are indeed related), predictive validity (i.e., the degree to which a measure relates to other measures separated by a determined period (= predicting scores in the other measure)), and external validity (i.e., the degree to which the results of a measure can be generalized beyond the original sample). Reliability refers to the degree to which a measure produces consistent, stable results when repeated again (“the trustworthiness or consistency of a measure, that is, the degree to which a test or other measurement instrument is free of random error, yielding the same results across multiple applications to the same sample”, (Association, n.d.b); “). Two main types of reliability are often assessed when evaluating a given measure. Internal consistency focuses on the relationship between items in the same measure to ensure they measure the same construct. (Test-) Retest reliability assesses a measure’s stability over time and estimates the relationship of the measurement scores on two different administration occasions (e.g., test day one followed by test day two three weeks later). 5.4.2 Existing social cognition measures Unfortunately, there are not too many measures that were designed to capture individual differences in social cognition in children and according to Beaudoin et al. (2020), social cognition studies rarely report psychometrical information. Reasons for such an insufficiency in individual differences measures might be the inherent challenges in methodological advancements. Developing a reliable and valid measure is time-consuming, and (due to some features of the publishing system) not overly rewarding. An example is a longitudinal study by Sodian et al. (2016) who have investigated how goals, beliefs and desires relate to moral ToM. They reported that “Contrary to expectations, neither goal encoding nor implicit false belief understanding was correlated with the Mo[ral] ToM false belief question” (p. 1227). Two main interpretations come to mind when reading about these results. On one hand, the hypothesis that goal encoding and implicit FB understanding should be related to moral ToM could be simply incorrect. On the other, more optimistic hand, the non-existent relationship could be explained by methodological issues: potentially, the applied measures could not capture variation between children. Interestingly, Sodian et al. (2016) stated two sentences later: “[…] verbal IQ was positively correlated with almost all the assessed variables” (p. 1227). Why should we care about this relationship? The measures for verbal IQ was - by definition - designed to capture individual differences in linguistic intelligence. Possibly, the measures that we use for correlational analyses need to leave room for individual differences in order to find them. What does it mean for a measure to be designed for individual differences? To drive the point home, let us imagine the opposite first. Many developmental study paradigms present children with two objects. For example, the Sally-Anne-task lets children witness how a ball gets moved from one box to a basked while another agent does or does not witness the change of location. Children then get asked where the agent believes the ball to be. Possible responses are (1) the box or (2) the basket. Similarly, in the traditional gaze following paradigm, an agent moves a toy into one of two boxes. Children themselves do not see where the toy was put but only see whether the agent looks to the (1) left- or (2) right-hand side. Common outcome measures focus on children’s looking or reaching behavior toward the two boxes. What becomes apparent is that these common social cognition tasks rely on dichotomous measures: either the child passes or fails the task. The child’s ability in question cannot be depicted on a continuous scale. A measure designed to capture individual differences would benefit from a continuous outcome measure, or, at least, more than one trial per child. 5.4.3 The need for a paradigm shift Classical experimental paradigms often give little weigh to individual differences. When research questions focus on condition differences or the average age in which children pass a given social-cognitive task, variation between children is often handled by excluding outliers and calculating mean scores. As such, individual differences are regarded as noise or measurement error (Kidd et al., 2018). I will argue that we need to question the interpretation that variation between individuals equals noise and should be thrown away. Indeed, some research agendas rely on the assumption that meaningful individual differences exist. For example, correlational studies aim to quantify the degree of a relationship between two variables. They assess whether children that perform well in one task also perform well in another task. In order to assess such a relationship, an individual’s ability must be measured accurately on both scales. Indeed, the correlation between two measures cannot be greater than the reliability of the individual measures. For example, let us assume we apply measure A with a known reliability estimate of .5 and measure B with a reliability estimate of .6 … Many research questions in developmental psychology are indeed individual differences questions. Research focusing on the (dis)continuity of development must also rely on measures that can accurately track children’s abilities across time. A textbook example is the question whether children develop some abilities similar to a tree that grows continuously over time or rather like a butterfly that develops in distinct stages (from caterpillar, to cocoon, to butterfly). An example of a gradual process developmental theory comes from Vygotsky. Theories within this realm assume that change occurs slowly and gradually. An example of a stage-like developmental theory comes from Piaget who assumes that children … Children are assumed to go through these qualitatively different stages in a set universal order. First step is describing change, second step is explaining change! What changes over time and why? Process models. Universality in development? Maybe absolute differences in test scores but similar patterns overall? Interestingly, sometimes the same study paradigms are used for correlational research that were previously designed for experimental research focusing on group averages. It becomes apparent that this approach is 5.4.4 A potential way forward That this endeavor is nevertheless worth it can be seen from a historical perspective on science. Often, only after new measurement techniques, new knowledge could be gained and theories could be advanced. In other words: newly designed methods led to new opportunities and research questions. [todo example, maybe Teleskop] correlations only as large as the least reliable measure; we correlate lots but rarely know the psychometrics of the tasks potentiall issues: group-level averages small sample sizes low trial numbers dichotomous measures missing or unsatisfactory psychometric properties Poor measurement on an individual level might conceal relationships between different aspects of cognition and may obscure developmental change Wishlist: Objective, standardized measures (compared to anecdotal evidence, diaries) Parametric measures (= continuous instead of dichotomous.

Child Development (In-Principle Acceptance of Registered Report Stage 1: Study Design). PsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/x4jbm Abstract: Do toddlers and adults engage in spontaneous Theory of Mind (ToM)? Evidence from anticipatory looking (AL) studies suggests that they do. But a growing body of failed replication studies raised questions about the paradigm’s suitability. In this multi-lab collaboration, we test the robustness of spontaneous ToM measures. We examine whether 18- to 27-month-olds’ and adults’ anticipatory looks distinguish between two basic forms of an agent’s epistemic states: knowledge and ignorance. In toddlers [ANTICIPATED n = 520 50% FEMALE] and adults [ANTICIPATED n = 408, 50% FEMALE] from diverse ethnic backgrounds, we found [SUPPORT/NO SUPPORT] for epistemic state-based action anticipation. Future research can probe whether this conclusion extends to more complex kinds of epistemic states, such as true and false beliefs.

C., Engicht, J., Haun, D., Gagarina, N., &amp; Koch, T. (2023). PREVIC: An adaptive parent report measure of expressive vocabulary in children between 3 and 8 years of age. PsyArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hvncp Abstract: Parent report measures have proven to be a valuable research tool to study early language development. Caregivers are given a list of words and are asked which of them their child has already used. However, most available measures are not suited for children beyond infancy, come with substantial licensing costs or lack a clear psychometric foundation. Here we present the PREVIC (Parent Report of Expressive Vocabulary in Children), an open access, high quality vocabulary checklist for German-speaking children between three and eight years of age. The PREVIC was constructed leveraging the advantages of Item Response Theory: we designed a large initial item pool of 379 words and collected data from N = 1190 caregivers of children between three and eight years of age. Based on this data, we computed a range of fit indices for each item (word) and used an automated item selection algorithm to compile a final pool that contains items that a) vary in difficulty and b) fit the Rasch (one-parameter logistic) model. The resulting task is highly reliable and shows convergent validity. The IRT-based construction allowed us to design an adaptive version of the task, which substantially reduces the duration of the task while retaining measurement precision. The task – including the adaptive version – was implemented as a website and is freely accessible online (https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/previc-demo/). The PREVIC fills an important gap in the toolkit of researchers interested in language development and provides an ideal starting point for the development of converging measures in other languages. 10.3 oREV: An item response theory-based open receptive vocabulary task for 3- to 8-year-old children Citation: Bohn, M.*, Prein, J.*, Koch, T., Bee, R. M., Delikaya, B., Haun, D., &amp; Gagarina, N. (2024). oREV: An item response theory-based open receptive vocabulary task for 3- to 8-year-old children. Behavior Research Methods, 56(3), 2595–2605. https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02169-3 Abstract: Individual differences in early language abilities are an important predictor of later life outcomes. High-quality, easy-access measures of language abilities are rare, especially in the preschool and primary school years. The present study describes the construction of a new receptive vocabulary task for children between 3 and 8 years of age. The task was implemented as a browser-based web application, allowing for both in-person and remote data collection via the internet. Based on data from N = 581 German-speaking children, we estimated the psychometric properties of each item in a larger initial item pool via item response modeling. We then applied an automated item selection procedure to select an optimal subset of items based on item difficulty and discrimination. The so-constructed task has 22 items and shows excellent psychometric properties with respect to reliability, stability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The construction, implementation, and item selection process described here makes it easy to extend the task or adapt it to different languages. All materials and code are freely accessible to interested researchers. The task can be used via the following website: https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/orev-demo. 10.4 Validation of an open source, remote web-based eye-tracking method (WebGazer) for research in early childhood Citation: Steffan, A., Zimmer, L., Arias-Trejo, N., Bohn, M., Dal Ben, R., Flores-Coronado, M. A., Franchin, L., Garbisch, I., Grosse Wiesmann, C., Hamlin, J. K., Havron, N., Hay, J. F., Hermansen, T. K., Jakobsen, K. V., Kalinke, S., Ko, E.-S., Kulke, L., Mayor, J., Meristo, M., …, Prein, J., …, Schuwerk, T. (2024). Validation of an open source, remote web-based eye-tracking method (WebGazer) for research in early childhood. Infancy, 29(1), 31–55. https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12564 Abstract: Measuring eye movements remotely via the participant’s webcam promises to be an attractive methodological addition to in-person eye-tracking in the lab. However, there is a lack of systematic research comparing remote web-based eye-tracking with in-lab eye-tracking in young children. We report a multi-lab study that compared these two measures in an anticipatory looking task with toddlers using WebGazer.js and jsPsych. Results of our remotely tested sample of 18-27-month-old toddlers (N = 125) revealed that web-based eye-tracking successfully captured goal-based action predictions, although the proportion of the goal-directed anticipatory looking was lower compared to the in-lab sample (N = 70). As expected, attrition rate was substantially higher in the web-based (42%) than the in-lab sample (10%). Excluding trials based on visual inspection of the match of time-locked gaze coordinates and the participant’s webcam video overlayed on the stimuli was an important preprocessing step to reduce noise in the data. We discuss the use of this remote web-based method in comparison with other current methodological innovations. Our study demonstrates that remote web-based eye-tracking can be a useful tool for testing toddlers, facilitating recruitment of larger and more diverse samples; a caveat to consider is the larger drop-out rate.
