\chapter{Acknowledgments}\label{acknowledgments}

This dissertation rests on the shoulders of many inspiring, thought-provoking, motivating, and caring individuals. The last four years have been many different things --- but definitely neither boring nor stagnant. I want to thank everyone who has accompanied me on this journey.

My motivation to work on this dissertation is greatly due to my wonderful supervisors, Manuel and Daniel. Manuel, I cannot thank you enough for supporting and believing in me. You have taught me to critically challenge the status quo in research and to focus my energy on improving it --- pragmatically, step by step. Even though I do know that you believe there \emph{are} stupid questions, I felt very comfortable to ask you all along the way and I have benefited a lot from your patience with me. Thanks for roughly 200 meetings that have always left me more motivated and focused than I was before. I cannot imagine how science would be without you! Daniel, I am so happy and proud to have been a member of the CCP team. Thank you for offering me so many unique opportunities and unforgettable memories to travel to conferences and Uganda. I am deeply impressed by how quickly you get a grasp of a new project and know immediately which questions to ask. Thank you for being such an approachable director and having an open door to hear about my personal struggles. To my external supervisor, Robert: your teaching in Research Methods has turned my hate for statistics into a deep passion. Thanks for looking into open PhD positions with me and accompanying me along the way. Without you, I would have never even considered doing a PhD.

Thanks to all the people who made my travels to Uganda so enjoyable. I want to thank the members of the Budongo Families Project, especially Florence, Agnes, Joan and Joseph, for your warm welcome, all your help, hard work and heartfelt laughter.

Thanks to the new people that I met at the Leuphana. Sebastian, thank you for making it possible for me to pursue this doctoral title. Patricia, Franziska, Nele, and (again) Manuel, thanks for the welcoming and kind atmosphere in the LüneLütten lab. I am excited about what is to come next!

I am grateful to our wonderful cohort of PhDs at the MPI. You are a remarkable group of people, and I am very happy that we could share our daily struggles with each other. Noemi, I am so glad that we got to share our office for a (way too short) period of time and successfully solved the Christmas murder mystery with Marie. Wilson, thanks for enduring our laughter through the office walls, for countless lunch breaks together, and for sharing random stories about your fieldwork (and Iceland)! Without my work wife Marie, my time during this dissertation would not have been even half as great as it has been. I could (and have and will) cry thinking about not sharing my daily life with you anymore --- even though I completely trust in our relationship to live until we die. You have made me laugh so much, even if all I wanted to do was cry. Whatever it is that I am up to, I know you will always have my back and help me get back on my feet if I fail. I love your honesty, creativity, immense courage, charming awkwardness, and quirky sense of humor, and feel so honored that you are my friend. Thank you for being you!

My dear, dear family, I am so deeply grateful to know you by my side. Whenever I talk about individual differences, I think about you, Caro, and how we two sisters have the same parents and yet, are so different (in the very best way!!). I believe it is rare that siblings do not feel the need to compete with each other but can just love each other as they are. Thank you! To my mom, who told me right in the beginning that this journey would be a marathon and not a sprint. In some of my darker moments, you told me that even if it felt like I was about to fall, I could never --- because there are so many caring people who would catch me beforehand. Thank you for always having an open home and lots of support (in the form of love, food, vacations, phone calls, and advice) for me. To my dad, thanks for showing up to Leipzig so often and establishing a little concert routine together! I believe I have learned a lot of my problem-solving skills and patience from you. Even if you do not remember saying ``Mach Dinge richtig'' in Caro's and my childhood, I think my dissertation has greatly benefited from this sentence. Thank you, Louis, for helping with my move to Leipzig and spontaneously catching up over coffee in Leipzig or Berlin. To my grandpa, who told me he never worried that I would find my own way. And to my grandma, for all your curiosity, play, and love for children. To Resi and Milou, reminding me to cuddle and catch some fresh air. To the whole Gerken-Prein clan, I could not wish for a better family. Finally, we are reunited in the North.

Thank you to my amazing friends, who constantly remind me to live my life outside the office. To O74, OLAV, and Shubhangi, Schlotti, and Maló, for the cozy home we built together. All our little dance breaks, kitchen karaoke, and reading clubs made even COVID isolatino fun. Thanks for your patience with my mood swings and stealing lunch boxes! Thanks to Laura, for drying my tears, always having an open ear and heart, and helping me with every single move. To Marvin, for all the long hours of deep talk and starting the whole dancing journey with me. To the Kizomba community, especially Carlos and Benedikta, for forcing me to close my eyes, shut off my brain, and relax. Thanks to Arne, for nerding about statistics and providing way too much green mouth refreshener. To the Osna Coxis, especially Merle, Leah, and Alissa, for all the New Year's Eves, regular video calls, big hugs and words of comfort. To Niki, for constantly reaching out, joking around, and asking me how I'm doing. To Ani, Nica, and Schlotti for a lifelong friendship, wholehearted laughter, and a traveling diary. I am so grateful to have every single one of you in my life.

And finally, Steven. You have taken over so many different roles in my life over the last four years. In the beginning, I was simply grateful for your technological support and coding enthusiasm. Thank you for pushing me beyond my levels of comfort and believing in my programming skills (\ldots{} and for being my IT partner ;)). Quickly, however, coding became only one of the thousand topics that we would regularly discuss. Every morning, I looked forward to you making creepy, funny faces on our office door and having long, controversial, and nerdy conversations with you. I deeply miss you in my daily work life. And yet, I do appreciate all the changes that our relationship has gone through in recent years --- through all the highs and lows. I am sincerely grateful and glad to share my life with you. It is so easy being myself around you. Thank you for the commitment, stability, honesty, relaxation, music, joy, and silly jokes that you bring into my life. Your love and support means the world to me. I cannot wait for our new adventures together in Hamburg!

\chapter*{Authorship Note}\label{authorship}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Authorship Note}

In this dissertation, the plural pronoun ``we'' highlights the collaborative efforts within the presented scientific projects. The contributions of all co-authors of the included manuscripts are transparently and accurately attributed using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT; \mbox{\url{https://credit.niso.org}}) and can be found for each respective manuscript in \hyperref[appendixA]{Appendix A}. In situations where the primary responsible person is not explicitly defined, ``we'' refers to the efforts of this dissertation's author alone, as the plural pronoun ``we'' reflects standard practice in psychological scientific writings. This use does not diminish the author's significance in conceptualizing, executing, documenting, and interpreting the presented research. The singular pronoun ``I'' explicitly denotes personal opinions, reflections, and decisions regarding this dissertation's theoretical framework paper and its structure.

\chapter*{Structure of This Dissertation}\label{structure}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Structure of This Dissertation}

This dissertation is embedded in an overarching, still ongoing project led by Prof.~Dr.~Manuel Bohn (Leuphana University Lüneburg) and Prof.~Dr.~Daniel Haun (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig) that will create a new task battery for social cognition. This task battery aims to capture individual differences in children from diverse communities. The present thesis describes the steps that have already been undertaken in this endeavor: during my time as a doctoral candidate, we have designed, implemented, and validated the first task of the battery. We have decided to focus the first task on one of the most fundamental social-cognitive abilities: gaze following.

The present dissertation seeks to approach the development of the new gaze following paradigm from two sides: from a contentual and from a methodological perspective. The first part of the \hyperref[introduction]{Introduction} will focus on the psychological construct(s) underlying gaze following: I will describe the importance of human's social cognition and its milestones during child development. I will continue to elaborate on the construct of gaze following and its developmental milestones. I will end both these sections by considering studies that focus on individual differences and, subsequently, studies that were conducted cross-culturally. The second part of the \hyperref[introduction]{Introduction} will focus on the methodological considerations for constructing a new task battery. I will examine existing social cognition measures, identify common challenges and shortcomings, and establish the need for an individual differences- and cross-cultural research perspective.

The next chapter on the \hyperref[approach]{General Approach} of this dissertation will focus on our aims to develop a new gaze following measure that tackles these recognized methodological challenges. In the \hyperref[discussion]{General Discussion} chapter, I will summarize our study findings, discuss their limitations and provide an outlook for future studies in social cognition, focusing on individual differences and cross-cultural research.

\chapter{General Introduction}\label{introduction}

Humans share roughly 90 percent of their DNA with that of cats (\citeproc{ref-pontius2007initial}{Pontius et al., 2007}), and even close to 99 percent match our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (\citeproc{ref-waterson2005initial}{Waterson et al., 2005}). In many ways, we are comparable to other mammals: for example, we have eyes, ears, and noses that sensorily perceive the surroundings, and we have a neocortex that processes this information and performs higher-order brain functions like spatial reasoning and motor commands. In other domains, the animal kingdom far exceeds humans in their abilities and characteristics. Cheetahs can run up to 120 km/h and Peregrine falcons reach over 380 km/h when diving for prey. Bats and dolphins use echolocation to navigate in complete darkness. Ocean Sunfish have extraordinary reproductive abilities and can lay up to 300 million eggs at once, and the Greenland Shark can live as long as 400 years. So many other species are faster, produce more offspring, and live longer than humans. And yet, the majority of the earth's surface gets populated, exploited, and domesticated by mainly \emph{one} mammal: the \emph{Homo sapiens}. Which abilities brought humans to their ecological success? What makes us uniquely human?

In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft with a golden time capsule as a bold interstellar greeting. This Golden Record aimed to present the essence of Earth and humanity to potential extraterrestrial receivers. It included natural sounds, a selection of music from different cultures, greetings in 55 languages, and a photographic gallery. Among several pictures of mathematical formulas, scientific diagrams and planetary constellations, a large proportion of the included photos focused on the most fundamental human experiences. These pictures showed humans hunting and playing music together, eating and arguing at a full dinner table, collaboratively rowing a boat, competitively running against each other in marathons, nursing their children, and teaching them how to write. Strikingly, humans were rarely presented alone. These photographs, attempting to capture a comprehensive snapshot of Earth's environment, focused on humans interacting with each other in social and cultural groups.

Our ability to engage with one another in social interactions and communication has been highlighted in prominent evolutionary and psychological theories (e.g., \citeproc{ref-dunbar1998social}{Dunbar, 1998}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello2019becoming}{Tomasello, 2019}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello2003makes}{Tomasello \& Rakoczy, 2003}). Contrary to other mammals that act on others' observable actions, humans pay attention to each others' minds (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2015theorya}{Slaughter, 2015}). We perceive other agents in profoundly different ways than other entities in the world (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}), and ``social cues are among the most complex stimuli that the human brain has to process'' (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020, p. 14}). In 2013, the importance of social cognition has been recognized by the standard classification framework for mental disorders in the United States, the \hyperref[acronyms_DSMux20145]{Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM---5)} (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychiatricassociation2013diagnostic}{American Psychiatric Association, 2013}), which categorized social cognition as one of six core functional domains that can be affected by a neurocognitive disorder. The number of publications in different psychological domains highlights that many psychologists agree on the importance of social cognition. A quick search on the APA PsycNet (on June 25, 2024, at 17:00 CET) revealed 28,594 results for the search term ``social cognition'', while only 3,095 results appeared for ``spatial cognition'' and 95 appeared for ``physical cognition''. Humans have been described as ``ultra-social primates'' (\citeproc{ref-grossmann2022becoming}{Grossmann, 2022, p. 1}). We form social bonds (e.g., \citeproc{ref-bowlby1958nature}{Bowlby, 1958}), live (mostly) cooperatively (e.g., \citeproc{ref-tomasello2020adaptivea}{Tomasello, 2020}), and exchange information and learn through observing others (e.g., \citeproc{ref-csibra2009natural}{Csibra \& Gergely, 2009}). By relying on these strategies, knowledge and skills could be passed on from generation to generation --- which could not have possibly been acquired by one single individual (\citeproc{ref-henrich2015secreta}{Henrich, 2015}). Sociality --- and the cognitive abilities enabling it --- might very well be human's superpower.

A seminal paper by Herrmann et al. (\citeproc{ref-herrmann2007humansa}{2007}) tested the hypothesis that humans have unparalleled social-cognitive abilities. The researchers administered a cognitive test battery with 16 different tasks to chimpanzees, orangutans, and 2.5-year-old human infants. Indeed, the results showed that all three groups showed similar cognitive abilities within the physical world (space, quantities, causality), while human infants outperformed the chimpanzees and orangutans when it came to the social world (social learning, communication, \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{Theory of Mind (ToM)}). This study clearly underlines humans' remarkable cognitive abilities in the social realm.

\section{Social Cognition}\label{intro-socialcognition}

\subsection{Terminology}\label{terminology}

So far, I have argued for the importance of human's social-cognitive abilities. Before going deeper into the developmental literature on social cognition, let us clarify the term: What is social cognition? Interestingly, there is not one agreed-upon definition accepted by most psychologists (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}). Rather, cynical tongues might say that there are as many definitions of social cognition as there are research articles on it. As Ostrom put it in the Foreword of the Handbook of Social Cognition: ``I regard single-sentence definitions of social cognition to be slightly offensive {[}\ldots{]}. It would be more accurate to say that my preferred definition is the entire Handbook of Social Cognition, both this and the first edition combined'' (\citeproc{ref-ostrom1994foreword}{Ostrom, 1994, p. vii}). Indeed, researchers have argued that the non-specific and heterogeneous vocabulary hinders empirical and theoretical advancement: sometimes, a single concept is described by several different labels (\emph{i.e.,} convergence of meaning), while other concepts share the same label but refer to different constructs (\emph{i.e.,} divergence of meaning) (\citeproc{ref-quesque2024defining}{Quesque et al., 2024}; \citeproc{ref-quesque2020theoryofmind}{Quesque \& Rossetti, 2020}).

To get a clearer grasp on what developmental psychologists understand under the term \emph{Social Cognition}, we conducted a short expert survey at the beginning of my Ph.D.~(in Autumn/Winter 2020). We distributed an online questionnaire via personal contacts and emailing lists (e.g., cogdevsoc mailing list) to researchers broadly working in cognitive, comparative, cross-cultural and/or developmental psychology (see \hyperref[appendixC]{Appendix C}). Out of the 100 experts that completed the survey, more than half held a professorship, and the majority focused on basic research with children. First, we asked experts to define social cognition as a psychological construct. Exactly one third of the sample (33\%, n = 33) chose a definition by Glynn \& Watkiss (\citeproc{ref-glynn2016social}{2016}): ``Social cognition is the process by which actors, at individual or collective levels, decode and encode their social world, using mental models, knowledge structures and cultural understandings to process information, extract meaning and determine appropriate action.'' (p.~1). The next two most frequently chosen definitions focused similarly on the information processing aspects in environments with other agents (``{[}\ldots{]} encompasses all the information-processing mechanisms that underlie how people capture, process, store, and apply information about others to navigate social situations'' (\citeproc{ref-decety2020preface}{Decety, 2020, p. ix}); ``{[}\ldots{]} is concerned with the study of the thought processes, both implicit and explicit, through which humans attain understanding of self, others, and their environment'' (\citeproc{ref-moskowitz2013social}{Moskowitz, 2013, p. 1})). In the next step, we asked experts to name which dimensions they mentioned most often when discussing or writing about social cognition. The dimensions that were chosen by more than half of the experts were beliefs, knowledge, perspective-taking and intentions. Finally, we compiled a list of 21 social-cognitive abilities and asked experts to judge the likelihood of individual differences within these abilities: that is, how children of the same age would vary in performing these abilities. The experts assumed that children varied mostly in whether they manipulate emotions, deceive others, simulate others' reasoning processes, take anothers' perspective, and understand the subjectivity of knowledge states. Abilities that were assumed to vary the least between children of the same age were recognizing agents and following gaze. It appeared that experts assumed variation in many social-cognitive abilities and judged more room for individual differences, the more complex a given social-cognitive ability is.

When defining social cognition, a distinction must be made to the term \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} (also referred to as mentalizing, folk psychology, or psychological reasoning), which has been one of the most studied research areas in developmental cognitive science (\citeproc{ref-sabbagh2018replication}{Sabbagh \& Paulus, 2018}). While both terms are sometimes used synonymously, social cognition functions as the umbrella term that encompasses \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-quesque2024defining}{Quesque et al., 2024}). The term \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} was first coined by the primatologists Premack \& Woodruff (\citeproc{ref-premack1978does}{1978}), and is defined by the ability to view oneself and others as ``rational subjects with individual perspectives on the world'' (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022, p. 223}). It describes a system organized around mental states to explain and predict the behavior of agents. In other words, we try to understand actions by representing and attributing percepts, desires, and beliefs to ourselves and others --- summarized by Wellman as follows: ``In our everyday thinking we construe people as engaging in acts they \emph{think} will get them what they \emph{want}'' (\citeproc{ref-wellman2013universal}{Wellman, 2013, p. 69}). A core concept involved in \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} is \emph{meta-representation}: representing the content and manner in which agents represent the world from their perspective (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}). Meta-representational abilities rely on understanding that mental states hold information independent of the real world. Consequently, individuals need to comprehend that mental states can (1) differ between individuals, (2) conflict with their own mental states, (3) be inaccurate or false, and (4) be aspectual (\emph{i.e.,} objects can be represented under certain characteristics) (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}). \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} has been traditionally viewed as a unitary construct, but recent neurophysiological evidence suggests a multidimensional structure (\citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{Fu et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{Slaughter \& Repacholi, 2003}). Beaudoin et al. (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{2020}) have, for example, identified seven categories within \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}, namely ``emotions, desires, intentions, percepts, knowledge, beliefs, and mentalistic understanding of non-literal communication'' (p.5), and Fu et al. (\citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{2023}) have proposed the construct dimensions of cognitive (e.g., beliefs) vs.~affective (e.g., emotions), and intra- (\emph{i.e.,} concerning yourself) vs.~interpersonal (\emph{i.e.,} concerning other agents).

\subsection{Developmental Milestones}\label{developmental-milestones}

Human infants do not come into the world already possessing a complete social cognition (\citeproc{ref-tomasello2020adaptivea}{Tomasello, 2020}). Much of the developmental psychology research focuses on how children acquire the social-cognitive abilities that are needed to become full members of our society.

The development of social cognition starts with social perception:Newborns are preferentially interested in faces and biological motion (\citeproc{ref-simion2008predispositiona}{Simion et al., 2008}; \citeproc{ref-simion2015facea}{Simion \& Giorgio, 2015}). By two months, infants begin to socially smile and engage in proto-conversational social interactions (\citeproc{ref-rochat1999emerging}{Rochat et al., 1999}). An understanding of agency and others' intentions follows. For example, six-month-old infants expect that another agent acts in a goal-directed way (\citeproc{ref-woodward1998infants}{Woodward, 1998}). From 9 months onward, infants recognize contingencies in actions and realize that they are being imitated (\citeproc{ref-agnetta2004imitative}{Agnetta \& Rochat, 2004}). They react differently to similar behaviors if those behaviors have different intentions (e.g., unwilling vs.~unable agents, \citeproc{ref-behne2005unwillinga}{Behne, Carpenter, Call, et al., 2005}). In their second half of the first year, infants judge the rationality of goal-directed actions (\citeproc{ref-gergely1995taking}{Gergely et al., 1995}). Fourteen-month-olds imitate other actions in a rational way (\citeproc{ref-gergely2002rationala}{Gergely et al., 2002}). One and a half-year-olds imitate what an agent intended to do and not what they actually did (\citeproc{ref-meltzoff1995understanding}{Meltzoff, 1995}). At the same age, children help others by completing their previously failed actions (\citeproc{ref-warneken2006altruistica}{Warneken \& Tomasello, 2006}). Children between 18 and 21 months start to perform synchronous imitation, pretend play and recognize themselves in mirrors (touching their own face, not the mirror image) (\citeproc{ref-nielsen2004pretend}{Nielsen \& Dissanayake, 2004}).

After this so-called perception-goal psychology emerged in infancy, belief-desire psychology follows (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}). Around 18 months, children can recognize the subjectivity of desires and their relation to emotion (\citeproc{ref-repacholi1997earlya}{Repacholi \& Gopnik, 1997}). In their second year of life, children engage in Level I perspective-taking, in which they understand \emph{that} different persons perceive objects differently (\citeproc{ref-moll2006level}{Moll \& Tomasello, 2006}). Level II perspective-taking, which involves \emph{how} other agents perceive objects, emerges one year later, around three years of age (\citeproc{ref-moll2011perspectivetaking}{Moll \& Meltzoff, 2011}). At this age, children start to reference mental state by using terms like \emph{want}, \emph{think}, \emph{know}, \emph{pretend}, and \emph{dream} in their own utterances (\citeproc{ref-furrow1992mental}{Furrow et al., 1992}; \citeproc{ref-shatz1983acquisition}{Shatz et al., 1983}); Three-year-olds understand that perceptual access leads to knowledge: they understand that a person who has looked into a box knows its content (\citeproc{ref-hogrefe1986ignorance}{Hogrefe et al., 1986}). Most four-year-olds understand that they themselves and other agents can have a \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{False Belief (FB)} (\citeproc{ref-gopnik1988childrena}{Gopnik \& Astington, 1988}; \citeproc{ref-wellman2001metaanalysis}{Wellman et al., 2001}; \citeproc{ref-wimmer1983beliefs}{Wimmer \& Perner, 1983}): they grasp that how an agent acts depends not only on reality itself but also on what the agent believes (\citeproc{ref-wellman2024theory}{Wellman, 2024}). Interestingly, recent non-verbal measures (e.g., violation-of-expectation or anticipatory looking paradigms) have argued that infants as young as 15 months old show an understanding of \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} (\citeproc{ref-onishi200515monthold}{Onishi \& Baillargeon, 2005}; \citeproc{ref-senju2012spontaneous}{Senju, 2012}; \citeproc{ref-southgate2007action}{Southgate et al., 2007}). However, the replicability, reliability, validity of these implicit measures have been questioned by others (\citeproc{ref-dorrenberg2018how}{Dörrenberg et al., 2018}; \citeproc{ref-kulke2018implicit}{Kulke et al., 2018}; \citeproc{ref-sabbagh2018replication}{Sabbagh \& Paulus, 2018}).

In later school years, children then master higher-order, recursive \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks (\citeproc{ref-liddle2007higherorder}{Liddle \& Nettle, 2007}), and start to recognize faux-pas (\citeproc{ref-baron-cohen1999recognition}{Baron-Cohen et al., 1999}). Five-year-olds start to understand ironic speakers, but only nine- to ten-year-olds can accurately distinguish irony and sarcasm (\citeproc{ref-glenwright2010development}{Glenwright \& Pexman, 2010}).

Taken together, children show very early preferences for social stimuli, develop basic social-cognitive abilities in perception, goal, and intentionality understanding around the age of nine months, and refine these fundamental abilities between one and three years of age. At four to five years, children show more complex, meta-representational understandings of beliefs and desires and refine these, in turn, in the following years to gain a recursive, higher-order \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}.

\subsection{Individual Differences}\label{individual-differences}

Many decades of research in social cognition have taught us much about developmental milestones and at which average age children show certain social-cognitive abilities (for a review, see \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}, or the section above). Yet, anyone who has ever interacted with children notices that peers can differ substantially in their abilities. For example, one child could barely understand diverse desires, while another child from the same age group could already identify hidden emotions (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2015theorya}{Slaughter, 2015}).

\emph{Individual differences} describe the features in which agents vary from one another (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationindividual}{American Psychological Association, n.d.-a}). \emph{Inter}-individual differences focus on the variability \emph{between} children, while \emph{intra}-individual differences focus on the variability \emph{within} the same child. Asendorpf (\citeproc{ref-asendorpf1992stability}{1992}) have argued that inter-individual differences are often interpreted as trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) that are more or less stable over time, while intra-individual differences might capture state-like characteristics (e.g., motivation) or development within a given construct. The present thesis and the associated publications focus on inter-individual differences, often abbreviated to individual differences.

Studies on individual differences in social cognition mainly focus on the social-cognitive ability in question and its connection to family variables, social behavioral measures, and other cognitive abilities (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{Slaughter \& Repacholi, 2003}). For a list of examplary individual differences studies in social cognition, see the Introduction of \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}. As a quick summary, children's social-cognitive abilities impact their social lives and real-life outcomes (\citeproc{ref-hughes2004linksb}{Hughes \& Leekam, 2004}; \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}). For example, children with sophisticated social cognition show higher levels of prosocial behavior (\citeproc{ref-imuta2016theory}{Imuta et al., 2016}), peer popularity (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2015meta}{Slaughter et al., 2015}), mutual friendships (\citeproc{ref-fink2015friendlessnessa}{Fink, Begeer, Peterson, Slaughter, \& de Rosnay, 2015}; \citeproc{ref-fink2015friends}{Fink, Begeer, Peterson, Slaughter, \& De Rosnay, 2015}). High \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} scores relate to increased communication abilities like persuasive skills (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2013can}{Slaughter et al., 2013}), and academic achievements (\citeproc{ref-binnie2005tom}{Binnie, 2005}; \citeproc{ref-lecce2017theory}{Lecce et al., 2017}). Additionally, some negative, egoistic and manipulative behaviors, such as lying, deceiving and bullying, also seem to profit from advanced social-cognitive abilities (\citeproc{ref-ding2015theoryofminda}{Ding et al., 2015}; \citeproc{ref-gasser2009competent}{Gasser \& Keller, 2009}; \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}; \citeproc{ref-talwar2008social}{Talwar \& Lee, 2008}). In contrast, children who struggle with social cognition might experience challenges in their social competences. Decreased \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} performance has been found in children with language impairments (\citeproc{ref-nilsson2016theory}{Nilsson \& de López, 2016}; \citeproc{ref-stanzione2014environmental}{Stanzione \& Schick, 2014}) and atypical developmental pathways including \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)} (\citeproc{ref-baron-cohen2000theorya}{Baron-Cohen, 2000}), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\citeproc{ref-pineda-alhucema2018executiveb}{Pineda-Alhucema et al., 2018}), oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, eating disorders, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (\citeproc{ref-korkmaz2011theory}{Korkmaz, 2011}; \citeproc{ref-szamburska-lewandowska2021theory}{Szamburska-Lewandowska et al., 2021}). Importantly, most of these studies are correlational, so the direction of the cause and effect is often unclear (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2015theorya}{Slaughter, 2015}).

\subsection{Cross-Cultural Research}\label{cross-cultural-research}

Wellman (\citeproc{ref-wellman2013universal}{2013}) has argued that children's social-cognitive development is a particularly informative domain to assess in which ways people all over the world resemble and differ from one another. Several cross-cultural studies have documented substantial variation in this domain (\citeproc{ref-miller2018contributions}{Miller et al., 2018}; \citeproc{ref-wellman2014making}{Wellman, 2014}). For example, Wellman et al. (\citeproc{ref-wellman2011sequential}{2011}) showed Chinese children understood \hyperref[acronyms_KA]{Knowledge Access (KA)} at an earlier age than U.S. American children (who, in turn, understood \hyperref[acronyms_DB]{Diverse Beliefs (DB)} earlier). Cultural values (e.g., individualist vs.~collectivist) and caregiver-child conversations emphasizing different mental states (e.g., knowing vs.~thinking) might explain these differences in \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} sequence (\citeproc{ref-johnston2002cultural}{Johnston \& Wong, 2002}). Evidence for this hypethesis also comes from a study conducted in New Zealand and Iran by Taumoepeau et al. (\citeproc{ref-taumoepeau2019crosscultural}{2019}) who found that child-directed mental state talk was related to children's \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}.

An interesting observation has been the so-called \emph{Opacity Doctrine} (\citeproc{ref-dixson2018scalingb}{Dixson et al., 2018}): communities on remote Pacific islands avoid reasoning or talking about mental states of others as this is deemed inappropriate and impossible. The inclination to not speculate about others' mental states may influence the onset, developmental trajectory, and/or expression of children's \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} abilities. Mayer \& Träuble (\citeproc{ref-mayer2013synchronyb}{2013}) found a delayed onset of \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding in Samoan children, with the majority of children being eight years or older. Similarly, Dixson et al. (\citeproc{ref-dixson2018scalingb}{2018}) found that ni-Vanuatu children, especially in rural areas, passed \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} tasks later than their Western counterparts.

Despite these documented cross-cultural differences, some studies also revealed similarities in social-cognitive development between diverse communities. For example, Barrett et al. (\citeproc{ref-barrett2013early}{2013}) studied early \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding in three traditional, small-scale, non-Western communities. They found that one- to four-year-old children from Salar (China), Shuar/Colono (Ecuador) and Yasawan (Fiji) communities showed similar response patterns in three spontaneous looking measures to classical studies conducted in Western communities (\citeproc{ref-barrett2013early}{Barrett et al., 2013}). Callaghan et al. (\citeproc{ref-callaghan2005synchrony}{2005}) have shown that children from Canada, Samoa, India, and Peru show similar developmental trajectories in \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding, with some variations at which specific age the majority of children pass the task.

In sum, the order and timing in which children are described to pass classical \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks (\emph{i.e.,} \hyperref[acronyms_DD]{Diverse Desires (DD)}, \hyperref[acronyms_DB]{DB}, \hyperref[acronyms_KA]{KA}, content \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB}, \hyperref[acronyms_HE]{Hidden Emotions (HE)}) varies between different communities, which might rely on differences in large-scale cultural, and small scale family factors (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022, p. 230}). Yet, ``children go from consistently wrong to consistently correct worldwide, typically in the preschool years'' (\citeproc{ref-wellman2024theory}{Wellman, 2024}). At the end, traditional cross-cultural studies often take absolute differences in performance patterns as evidence for distinct cognitive processes or developmental trajectories --- an approach which might be questioned (see \hyperref[intro-methods]{Methodological Considerations}).

\section{Gaze Following}\label{intro-gaze}

\subsection{Relevance and Functions of Eye Gaze}\label{relevance-and-functions-of-eye-gaze}

In contrast to other primates, human eyes have a distinctive morphology: they have (1) a depigmented, white sclera, (2) a large exposition of the sclera compared to the eye outline, (3) a stark color contrast between the sclera, the black pupil, the colored iris, and (4) are enlongated in the horizontal direction (\citeproc{ref-kobayashi1997unique}{Kobayashi \& Kohshima, 1997}, \citeproc{ref-kobayashi2001unique}{2001}). These characteristics heighten the visibility of gaze direction under visually challenging conditions (\citeproc{ref-kano2022unique}{Kano et al., 2022}). Furthermore, the ratio of the visible sclera on each side of the pupil might enable humans to detect gaze direction (\citeproc{ref-anstis1969perception}{Anstis et al., 1969}; \citeproc{ref-symons2004you}{Symons et al., 2004}; \citeproc{ref-todorovic2006geometrical}{Todorović, 2006}). The \emph{cooperative eye hypothesis} suggests that the morphology of the human eye specifically evolved to facilitate gaze following and thereby, communication and cooperation (\citeproc{ref-tomasello2007reliance}{Tomasello et al., 2007}). Findings consistent with this hypothesis show that humans are quicker and more accurate in judging eye gaze when the sclera is depigmented compared to pigmented (\citeproc{ref-yorzinski2021sclera}{Yorzinski et al., 2021}). Additionally, neurotypically developing children and adults (but not children with \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{ASD}) show a preference for eye stimuli with visible white sclera (\citeproc{ref-segal2016preferences}{Segal et al., 2016}; \citeproc{ref-wolf2023fiveyearold}{Wolf et al., 2023}).

Eye gaze has a variety of different functions and the ``eyes can both signal and perceive'' (\citeproc{ref-gobel2015dual}{Gobel et al., 2015, p. 359}). As such, developmental theories often highlight the role of gaze as a signal for others' attention and intention (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}). Gaze can be informative for external states and direct attention to specific features in our environment (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}); Frith (\citeproc{ref-frith2008social}{2008}); Gobel et al. (\citeproc{ref-gobel2015dual}{2015}){]}. Compared to other cues like head or body orientation, the eyes are a clearer indicator of the attentional focus of another agent (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}). Gaze following enables people to learn through observation (\citeproc{ref-frith2007social}{Frith \& Frith, 2007}).

Additionally, eye gaze can signal intentions to others, like invitations to approach and engage or warnings to retreat (\citeproc{ref-frith2008social}{Frith, 2008}; \citeproc{ref-gobel2015dual}{Gobel et al., 2015}; \citeproc{ref-shepherd2010following}{Shepherd, 2010}). Looking into anothers' eyes can serve as a ``window into the mind'' (\citeproc{ref-shepherd2010following}{Shepherd, 2010, p. 10}), which permits a glimpse into their beliefs and desires. Therefore, gaze can signal internal emotional and mental states (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}), and as such, is foundational for more complex social-cognitive abilities (\citeproc{ref-shepherd2010following}{Shepherd, 2010}). For example, following eye gaze facilitates anticipating likely future actions of an agent (\citeproc{ref-friesen2011gaze}{Friesen \& Rao, 2011}; \citeproc{ref-zohary2022gaze}{Zohary et al., 2022}).

Eye gaze is also relevant for pragmatic and language abilities. Monitoring the eye gaze of a conversational partner enables turn taking (\citeproc{ref-degutyte2021role}{Degutyte \& Astell, 2021}), the formation of common ground (\citeproc{ref-bohn2018common}{Bohn \& Köymen, 2018}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello2007reliance}{Tomasello et al., 2007}), and learning new words by identifying the target object (\citeproc{ref-hernik2019infant}{Hernik \& Broesch, 2019}; \citeproc{ref-macdonald2013eye}{Macdonald \& Tatler, 2013}).

In sum, eye gaze is fundamental for the vast majority of social interactions, communication, collaboration, cultural and social learning (\citeproc{ref-bohn2019pervasive}{Bohn \& Frank, 2019}; \citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}; \citeproc{ref-frith2012mechanisms}{Frith \& Frith, 2012}; \citeproc{ref-hessels2020how}{Hessels, 2020}; \citeproc{ref-moore2008development}{Moore, 2008}; \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello2003makes}{Tomasello \& Rakoczy, 2003}).

\subsection{Terminology}\label{terminology-1}

There exist a number of different concepts that describe an agent's perception of another's eye gaze (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}; \citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}). I will focus on defining \emph{mutual gaze}, \emph{gaze following}, \emph{gaze alternation}, \emph{joint attention}, and \emph{shared attention} (arranged by (most likely) order of increasing complexity in cognitive processing and intentionality understanding).

Mutual gaze describes the attention of two agents that is directed to each other (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}); for example, when a child and their caregiver look at each other. As a form of dyadic gaze, it is considered as a sign for social engagement (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}).

Gaze following marks the process of identifying the attentional focus of another agent and turning one's gaze in the same direction (\citeproc{ref-delbianco2019developmental}{Del Bianco et al., 2019}). For example, gaze following occurs when an agent observes that the others' gaze is not aimed at them and subsequently redirects their attention along the others' line of sight to a specific point in space (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}). Some studies still refer to gaze following, even when the changes in gaze direction are confounded with simultaneous posture, head and voice changes (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}).

Gaze alternation describes switching between looking at an object and an agent's eyes, and is a fundamental component of joint attention (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}). Joint attention, in turn, describes an episode in which one agent (\emph{i.e.,} the initiator) gazes at an object which causes another agent (\emph{i.e.,} the responder) to align and turn their gaze to the same object (\citeproc{ref-stephenson2021gaze}{Stephenson et al., 2021}). It is similar to gaze following except that the attentional focus is directed at a specific target/object (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}), and as such, involves a triadic relation (``triadic connectedness'', (\citeproc{ref-bard2021joint}{Bard et al., 2021})) between two agents and an object (\citeproc{ref-lee1998children}{Lee et al., 1998}). A related term is shared attention, which has been proposed to include the awareness of the common attentional state of both agents (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}). Both individuals intentionally establish that they are looking at the same object; for example, by back-checking between the object and the other agent's gaze. However, some researchers use the terms joint and shared attention synonymously (\citeproc{ref-emery2000eyes}{Emery, 2000}).

The present dissertation and the included studies focus on the concept of gaze following. Gaze following is often seen as a pre-requisite and first ingredient of a joint attention episode (\citeproc{ref-moll2011perspectivetaking}{Moll \& Meltzoff, 2011}; \citeproc{ref-stephenson2021gaze}{Stephenson et al., 2021}). Researchers have argued whether gaze following reflects an intentional attribution of mental states toward other agents or whether it serves as a more automatic, implicit precursor of later-developing \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} abilities (\citeproc{ref-carlson2013theorya}{Carlson et al., 2013}). Beaudoin et al. (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{2020}) categorized ``adopting the visual perspective of another person'' into the ``percepts'' category in a \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} classification. Moll \& Meltzoff (\citeproc{ref-moll2011perspectivetaking}{2011}) have argued that joint attention and gaze following could be seen as Level 0 perspective-taking. Regardless of whether gaze following is seen as a component of \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} or not, it remains a central cornerstone in social cognition.

\subsection{Developmental Milestones}\label{developmental-milestones-1}

Children's cognitive abilities related to eye gaze evolve from sensitivity to dyadic social interactions to initiation of triadic interactions; with sensitivity to these interactions preceding their initiation, and dyadic interactions preceding triadic ones (\citeproc{ref-striano2006social}{Striano \& Reid, 2006}). Infants as young as three months turn their eyes in the same direction as an adult when they turn their head and gaze toward one of two objects(\citeproc{ref-dentremont1997demonstration}{D'Entremont et al., 1997}). While this is often considered as the onset of gaze following, infants initially rely more on head than gaze direction (\citeproc{ref-lempers1977development}{Lempers et al., 1977}; \citeproc{ref-michel2021effects}{Michel et al., 2021}). Brooks \& Meltzoff (\citeproc{ref-brooks2005development}{2005}) have consequently argued that infants begin to ``view others as `body orienters'\,'' (p.~541) before they rely on eye gaze as a significant cue.

By the age of one, infant's gaze following abilities become more sophisticated (\citeproc{ref-shepherd2010following}{Shepherd, 2010}), and children's abilities evolve from understanding dyadic to triadic eye gaze (\citeproc{ref-lee1998children}{Lee et al., 1998}). Infants are more likely to follow gaze when the agent's eyes are open versus closed (\citeproc{ref-brooks2002importance}{Brooks \& Meltzoff, 2002}). They can use gaze (and emotional) cues to predict the next action of another agent (\citeproc{ref-phillips2002infants}{Phillips et al., 2002}). By 14 months, gaze following is contingent on past experiences with the interaction partner's looks: when another agent had previously acted as a ``reliable looker'' (\emph{i.e.,} smiling at a container with a toy), infants were more likely to follow gaze behind a barrier than when the agent had previously acted as an ``unreliable looker'' (\emph{i.e.,} smiling at an empty container) (\citeproc{ref-chow2008see}{Chow et al., 2008}). At the same age, infants interpret pointing and ostensive eye gaze as a relevant communicative cue for finding a hidden toy (\citeproc{ref-behne2005oneyearolds}{Behne, Carpenter, \& Tomasello, 2005}). By 18 months, infants follow gaze to locations outside their immediate line of sight (\citeproc{ref-butterworth1991minds}{Butterworth \& Jarrett, 1991}; \citeproc{ref-corkum1995development}{Corkum \& Moore, 1995}; \citeproc{ref-deak2000effects}{Deák et al., 2000}; \citeproc{ref-moll200412}{Moll \& Tomasello, 2004})

Interestingly, explicit and precise discrimination of gaze direction might emerge later in development: three-year-olds are TODO (\citeproc{ref-doherty2009rapid}{Doherty et al., 2009})

\subsection{Individual Differences}\label{individual-differences-1}

An individual's ability to follow gaze has consequences for their real social life, particularly with regards to social interactions and communications with others (\citeproc{ref-carpenter1998social}{Carpenter et al., 1998}). For example, gaze following has been argued to trigger comprehension of an agent's intentional relations to objects --- ``an understanding that may play a critical role in word learning (at least the learning of object labels)''(\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008, p. 60}). The role of gaze following and language abilities has been further highlighted by the finding of Brooks \& Meltzoff (\citeproc{ref-brooks2005development}{2005}) who showed that gaze following at ten months is predictive of children's language abilities at 18 months. Fitting to this result, children who followed an agent's gaze longer to the target object showed larger vocabularies at 18 months (mediated by children's object processing ability)(\citeproc{ref-okumura2017individual}{Okumura et al., 2017}).

Additionally, infants' gaze and point following abilities in triadic interactions correlate with their ability to recognize imitation; that is, distinguishing whether they were imitated by another agent or whether the same object manipulations where mechanically performed (independently of any visible actions by the other agent) (\citeproc{ref-agnetta2004imitative}{Agnetta \& Rochat, 2004}).

Contextual factors in children's social and emotional environment could predict individual differences in the emergence of gaze following: infants showing a secure attachment style and being raised by mothers with lower levels of maternal postpartum depression showed higher frequencies of gaze following (\citeproc{ref-astor2020social}{Astor et al., 2020}).

Gaze following research has also gained substantial traction in clinical research focusing on developmental disorders, especially in \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{ASD} (\citeproc{ref-delbianco2019developmental}{Del Bianco et al., 2019}). One diagnostic criterion for \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{ASD} is an alteration in non-verbal communication, including the social use of eye contact (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychiatricassociation2013diagnostic}{American Psychiatric Association, 2013}). Forgeot d'Arc et al. (\citeproc{ref-forgeotdarc2017gaze}{2017}) reported that ``gaze direction detection was less accurate in autism spectrum disorder than in control participants'' (p.~100). Preferential looking times to eye and mouth regions of the face were shown to be reduced in children with \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{ASD} (\citeproc{ref-constantino2017infant}{Constantino et al., 2017}). While some individuals with \hyperref[acronyms_ASD]{ASD} exhibit no impairment in gaze perception, others may be less inclined to initiate eye contact and join attention, which might influence the course of social interactions (\citeproc{ref-stephenson2021gaze}{Stephenson et al., 2021}).

\subsection{Cross-Cultural Research}\label{intro-gaze-cc}

Few studies have assessed children's gaze following abilities across diverse communities. One example is a study by Callaghan et al. (\citeproc{ref-callaghan2011early}{2011}). They examined gaze following in 12- and 17-month-old children from rural Canada (n=35), Peru (n=38), and India (n=65) in scenarios in which an agent gazed either at a toy behind a barrier (experimental condition) or a sticker in front of it (control condition). Despite varying absolute crawling rates among the communities, children crawled more frequently towards a barrier when an agent gazed at an object behind it, rather than in front (\citeproc{ref-callaghan2011early}{Callaghan et al., 2011}).

Additionally, Hernik \& Broesch (\citeproc{ref-hernik2019infant}{2019}) assessed whether differences in face-to-face interaction influence gaze following in five- to seven-month old infants in Vanuatu. While face-to-face interactions are less frequent in Vanuatu than in Western communities, infants showed similar gaze patterns and followed gaze more when they were communicatively addressed beforehand (by infant-directed speech). The authors conclude that ``following of gaze in communicative contexts may be available to human infants from various cultural groups regardless of the frequency of exposure to communicative gaze signals from caregivers'' (\citeproc{ref-hernik2019infant}{Hernik \& Broesch, 2019, p. 7}).

Other cross-cultural research has focused on mutual eye gaze, joint attention, and the factors that influence these abilities. For example, cross-cultural variation has been documented in how infants are typically held, which naturally affects how likely they engage in face-to-face interactions and thereby receive the opportunity to engage in mutual gaze (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}). Kaluli mothers in Papua New Guinea tend to carry infants facing away from them, and infants and caregivers rarely look into each other's eyes (\citeproc{ref-ochs1984language}{Ochs \& Schieffelin, 1984}). Similarly, mothers from the Gusii community in Kenya focus less on gaze and verbal interactions and more in touch than mothers from Boston, USA (\citeproc{ref-richman1992culturala}{Richman et al., 1992}). Interestingly, Gusii mothers might use gaze aversion to calm an infant when they are excited (\citeproc{ref-dixon1981motherinfant}{Dixon et al., 1981}).

Regarding joint attention, a study by Childers et al. (\citeproc{ref-childers2007jointa}{2007}) examined whether children's ability levels were affected by being carried on the caregiver's back. Similar qualitative and quantitative behavioral patterns in Ngas-speaking infants in Nigeria (though notice the small sample size of 16 participants) as those found in English-speaking infants in the USA speak against a potential effect of caregivers' carrying style (\citeproc{ref-childers2007jointa}{Childers et al., 2007}). Moreno et al. (\citeproc{ref-moreno2021communicative}{2021}) studied children's social interaction, joint attention, and behavior regulation across three communities in Columbia. They found no between-community differences with regards to joint attention and conclude that this speaks for the universality of joint attention, especially given the Wayuú's distinct socioeconomic and cultural characteristics differing from the other two communities (\citeproc{ref-moreno2021communicative}{Moreno et al., 2021}). In contrast, Gavrilov et al. (\citeproc{ref-gavrilov2012sociocultural}{2012}) found that social-cultural factors (e.g., adherence to traditional values and parental education) influenced Israeli children in their initiation of joint attention.

Taken together, most studies focusing on the perception of eye gaze underline similarities across diverse cultural communities, while some results indicate variation with regards to absolute behavioral differences and the social-environmental factors influencing those.

\section{Methodological Considerations}\label{intro-methods}

\subsection{Relevance of Individual- and Community-level Variation}\label{relevance-of-individual--and-community-level-variation}

Classical cognitive science assumes that human cognition is universal and invariant in its structure (\citeproc{ref-kroupin2024newtona}{Kroupin et al., 2024}; \citeproc{ref-levinson2012originalb}{Levinson, 2012}). Consequently, traditional experiments often rely on small sample sizes to inform their theory and give little weigh to individual differences (\citeproc{ref-bohn2024understanding}{Bohn et al., 2024}). When research questions focus on condition differences or the average age in which children pass a given social-cognitive task, variation between children is often handled by excluding outliers and calculating mean scores. As such, between-group differences are highlighted as a sign of genuine cognitive variation, while individual differences are regarded as noise or measurement error (\citeproc{ref-amir2020crosscultural}{Amir \& McAuliffe, 2020}; \citeproc{ref-kidd2018individual}{Kidd et al., 2018}). I will argue that we need to question the theoretical and statistical stance that variation between individuals and/or communities equals noise and should be thrown away.

Why should we care about individual differences? Indeed, many research questions in developmental psychology are questions concerning individual differences. A textbook example from developmental psychology is the question of (dis)continuity in development. Do children evolve like a butterfly that goes through distinct stages --- from caterpillar, to cocoon, to butterfly? Or do they develop similar to a tree that grows continuously over time (\citeproc{ref-parnes2022infant}{Parnes \& Pagano, 2022, p. 8})? Two historically influential theories of cognitive development highlight the different stances. A classical example of a stage-like developmental theory is Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (\citeproc{ref-piaget1929child}{Piaget, 1929}, \citeproc{ref-piaget1936origins}{1936}, \citeproc{ref-piaget1954construction}{1954}, \citeproc{ref-piaget1964cognitive}{1964}, \citeproc{ref-piaget1971theory}{1971}). Piaget assumed that children progress through qualitatively different stages in a set universal order (\emph{i.e.,} sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational), and in each stage, interpret the world differently, with increasing levels of complexity. An example of a gradual process developmental theory is Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory (\citeproc{ref-vygotsky1962thought}{Vygotsky, 1962}, \citeproc{ref-vygotsky1978mind}{1978}, \citeproc{ref-vygotsky1987thinking}{1987}). Vygotsky assumed that change occurs slowly and gradually, and that cognitive development is driven by an individual's social interactions and cultural context --- not pre-defined by certain stages. According to this theory, social interaction shapes social cognition. In order to test these opposing theoretical frameworks and examine the (dis)continuity of development, studies must be able to accurately track children's individual abilities across time. Inadequate assessment of an individual's (social) cognition could, otherwise, mask connections between cognitive processes or overshadow developmental trajectories.

Fitting in this research direction are studies that aim to describe and, most importantly, explain change. To answer which abilities change over time and why, process models aim to define and predict individual differences. As Smaldino (\citeproc{ref-smaldino2019better}{2019}) has argued, good scientific theories rest on testable hypotheses and predictions that can be described by formal computational models. These models would benefit from accurate, reliable and replicable measures on an individual level (\citeproc{ref-smaldino2019better}{Smaldino, 2019}). Individual differences studies act as a powerful tool to build and test developmental theories and the structure of social cognition (\citeproc{ref-happe2017structure}{Happé et al., 2017}). Additionally, individual differences studies are needed to design (clinical or educational) intervention programs. Capturing change before and after an intervention helps to evaluate its efficacy.

Research focusing on the universality or variability of social cognition rests on studying developmental pathways in different communities. Contrary to classical cognitive science, cross-cultural research assumes that human cognition forms and adapts to ecological and cultural environments. A period of especially sensitive and plastic brain growth is early childhood, in which children are fully exposed to these ecological and cultural inputs (\citeproc{ref-haun2015comparativea}{Haun, 2015}). Environmental factors interact with children's unique developmental trajectories and outcomes. While aggregated measures of experience and cognition may cluster within communities, an individual's developmental trajectory may point in different directions than a group-level comparison. Consequently, we need to measure and link a child's cognitive development and their daily experiences (\emph{i.e.,} how a child perceives their everyday cultural and ecological environments) on an individual level across different communities (\citeproc{ref-bohn2024understanding}{Bohn et al., 2024}).

In sum, the need for an individual differences perspective on child development is more than evident. Studying individuals from diverse socio-cultural communities will broaden the scope of children's living conditions and developmental pathways that we can capture (\citeproc{ref-bohn2024understanding}{Bohn et al., 2024}).

\subsection{Terminology}\label{terminology-2}

Before I will consider the current state of existing social cognition tasks, I will clarify some terms that are relevant in this context. First, the terms \emph{variability}, \emph{variation}, and \emph{variance} are important when describing individual differences. The definitions of variability and variation greatly resemble each other according to the APA Dictionary of Psychology (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationvariability}{American Psychological Association, n.d.-d}, \citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationvariation}{n.d.-f}): both terms focus on differences between individuals that can be applied to the behavioral level. As in most of the developmental literature, the terms variability and variation will be used interchangeably in this work. Relatedly, the term \emph{variance} denotes a statistical measure for the degree to which group members differ from one another. It describes the dispersion of a distribution by calculating how far the values of a sample spread out from their average value. Consequently, a smaller variance means less differences between individuals in a given sample (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationvariance}{American Psychological Association, n.d.-e}).

Psychometric properties of a task are often assessed by considering its \emph{validity} and \emph{reliability}. \emph{Validity} concerns the truthfulness of a task or the degree to which a task captures what it is designed to measure conceptually (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationvalidity}{American Psychological Association, n.d.-c}). There are several different types of validity. In the context of this work, we focus on \emph{convergent} validity (\emph{i.e.,} the degree to which two tasks that should be theoretically related are indeed related), \emph{predictive} validity (\emph{i.e.,} the degree to which a task relates to other tasks separated by a determined period (= predicting scores in the other task)), and \emph{external} validity (\emph{i.e.,} the degree to which the results of a task can be generalized beyond the original sample). \emph{Reliability} refers to the degree to which a task produces consistent, stable results when repeated again, or the degree to which a task is free of random measurement error (\citeproc{ref-americanpsychologicalassociationreliability}{American Psychological Association, n.d.-b}). Often, two main types of reliability are assessed when evaluating a given task. \emph{Internal consistency} focuses on the relationship between items in the same task to ensure they measure the same construct. \emph{(Test-) Retest reliability} assesses a task's stability over time and estimates the relationship of the task scores on two different administration occasions (e.g., test day one followed by test day two three weeks later).

\subsection{Existing Social Cognition Tasks}\label{existing-social-cognition-tasks}

As I have argued, many fundamental research questions in developmental psychology are interested in, or build upon, individual differences. Let us now consider whether existing social cognition and \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks are capable to measure individual differences by first reviewing one example. A longitudinal study by Sodian et al. (\citeproc{ref-sodian2016understanding}{2016}) investigated how goals, beliefs and desires relate to moral \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}. They reported that ``Contrary to expectations, neither goal encoding nor implicit false belief understanding was correlated with the Mo{[}ral{]} \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} false belief question'' (p.~1227). Two main interpretations of these results come to mind. First, the researchers' hypothesis could simply be incorrect: potentially, goal encoding and implicit \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding are not related to moral \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}. Alternatively, and more optimistically, the non-existent relationship could be explained by methodological issues. Following this interpretation, the applied tasks could not accurately capture variation between children and therefore, did not find a relationship between the variables. Interestingly, Sodian et al. (\citeproc{ref-sodian2016understanding}{2016}) stated two sentences later: ``{[}\ldots{]} verbal IQ was positively correlated with almost all the assessed variables'' (p.~1227). What could this finding hint at? The task for verbal IQ was --- by definition --- designed to capture individual differences in linguistic intelligence. Possibly, the tasks used for correlational analyses need to leave room for individual differences in order to find and correlate them.

A classical developmental study paradigm ``involves describing a social scenario, sometimes using cartoons or puppets, and then asking test questions about what the protagonists feel, want, or know, or what they will do next'' (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2015theorya}{Slaughter, 2015, p. 170}). Often, they present children with two objects. For example, the Sally-Anne \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} task lets children witness how a ball gets moved from a box to a basket while another agent does or does not witness the change of location (\citeproc{ref-baron-cohen1985does}{Baron-Cohen et al., 1985}; \citeproc{ref-wimmer1983beliefs}{Wimmer \& Perner, 1983}). Children then get asked where the agent believes the ball to be. Possible responses are (1) the box or (2) the basket. Similarly, in the traditional gaze following paradigm (e.g., \citeproc{ref-astor2020social}{Astor et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-byers-heinlein2021development}{Byers-Heinlein et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-gredeback2010development}{Gredebäck et al., 2010}; \citeproc{ref-ishikawa2022physiological}{Ishikawa et al., 2022}) an agent gazes at a location or toy to her left- or right-hand side. The study outcome measures children's reaching behavior toward the two toys (or, in more recent studies, children's looking times). What becomes apparent is that these common social cognition tasks rely on dichotomous designs: an object is either on the left or right, or a child can either pass or fail the task. Finally, average scores are calculated; for example, the group level mean. Often, social cognition measures rely on only one or two trials (\citeproc{ref-cutting1999theory}{Cutting \& Dunn, 1999}; \citeproc{ref-henry2016clinical}{Henry et al., 2016}), which results in poor measurement accuracy and little sensitivity for individual differences (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}).

In order to assess the (inter)dependence of two cognitive abilities or environmental factors, an individual's score must be measured accurately on both scales. Indeed, the correlation between two tasks cannot be greater than the reliability of each individual task (\citeproc{ref-devellis2006classical}{DeVellis, 2006}). In light of this statistical feature, the psychometric properties, especially the validity and reliability of measures, gain in importance.

In the last ten years, a handful of articles has reviewed social cognition measures with regards to their measurement properties. For example, Ziatabar Ahmadi et al. (\citeproc{ref-ziatabarahmadi2015validity}{2015}) conducted a systematic review of comprehensive \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} measures for preschool children. Exclusion criteria were single tasks like the classical \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} task and/or no description of the measure's structure, validity and reliability. From the originally found 1237 articles, only 11 measures fulfilled all criteria and were included in the review. Of these 11 measures, six relied on verbal measures, two on a forced choice and three were filled in by children's caregivers. Only one measure was computerized. All 11 measures that were included were judged to be of moderate or high quality, and yet, even within this set, it was rare that validity (e.g., content, construct, criterion-related, or discriminate validity), test-retest reliability and internal consistency were all reported.

Another systematic review by Beaudoin et al. (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{2020}) has focused on \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} measures (including single tasks) for children aged 0 to 5 years of age. The authors argued that even though much progress has been made to study children's \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} understanding, drawing robust conclusions about (a)typical development remains challenging --- mainly because of methodological issues. According to their analysis, social cognition studies rarely report psychometrical information: less than one fifth of the identified 220 measures had information on their internal consistency, less than one tenth provided test-retest reliability estimates, and shockingly, even less measures had examined the construct validity. More than two thirds of the study samples solely relied on English-speaking participants, and the majority of measures focused on belief understanding (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}).

The most recent review by Fu et al. (\citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{2023}) systematically listed existing \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks for children from 0 to 12 years and categorized them by the captured dimension (cognitive vs.~affective, inter- vs.~intrapersonal), construct (e.g., knowledge access, diverse beliefs, first-order \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB}), presentation mode (e.g., spoken stories, cartoons, picture sequences, interviews), response mode (e.g., spoken language, multiple choices in words/pictures/objects, actions), underlying test theory (classical test theory vs.~\hyperref[acronyms_IRT]{Item Response Theory (IRT)}), and psychometric properties. Similarly to Beaudoin et al. (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{2020}), Fu et al. (\citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{2023}) highlighted the over-reliance on tasks measuring children's \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding. Furthermore, only one fifth of the 127 included \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks reported at least one reliability or validity estimate.

To summarize, developmental social cognition measures have been identified to have unkown, underdeveloped or inadequate psychometric qualities (e.g., \citeproc{ref-hiller2014validity}{Hiller et al., 2014}; \citeproc{ref-hutchins2008false}{Hutchins et al., 2008}; \citeproc{ref-mayes1996testretest}{Mayes et al., 1996}). While a vast variety of social cognition and \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks exist, there are not too many that are designed to capture individual differences in children.

\subsection{A Potential Way Forward}\label{a-potential-way-forward}

While the development of new tasks can be time-consuming and cumbersome, a historical perspective on science underlines that this endeavor is nevertheless worthwhile. A proverb from Abraham Maslow states that if all you have is a hammer, it becomes tempting to treat everything as if it was a nail (\citeproc{ref-maslow1962psychology}{Maslow, 1962}, \citeproc{ref-maslow1966psychology}{1966}). Often, newly designed methods led to new opportunities, research questions and improved theories. For instance, the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century revolutionized the field of astronomy. The telescope provided new means to study celestial bodies more closely and accurately than ever before, which led Galileo Galilei to observe the uneven surface of the Moon, sunspots, the phases of Venus, and Jupiter's moons. These telescopic observations challenged the prevailing geocentric model and provided empirical evidence for the the Copernican theory of heliocentrism, suggesting that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. As this example illustrates, methodological advancements do not only increase the level of measurement accuracy but can lead to significant shifts in scientific thought and knowledge.

In the research area of social cognition and/or gaze following, many researchers study (the emergence of) these social-cognitive abilities --- and yet, their work often revolves around similar study designs and new research questions or ``groundbreaking'' theories remain rare. ``Despite a steady stream of publications on the development of gaze following, we would like to argue that scientific progress within the field is slow---that data is produced with a high frequency but without adding substantial advancements to our understanding of the phenomenon under investigation and its long-term development'' (\citeproc{ref-astor2022gaze}{Astor \& Gredebäck, 2022, p. 192}). Methodological evolution, especially with a focus on individual- and community-level variation, could be seen as a promising tool (and simultaneously, goal) to stimulate the gaze following literature, challenge existing theories, and open up new research avenues. As Smaldino (\citeproc{ref-smaldino2019better}{2019}) has put it: ``If we can't reliably measure something, it's hard to build a theory about it. {[}\ldots{]} Better methods will help us get the right answers; models and measurements will ensure we ask the right questions'' (p.~9).

What characteristics would a new task need in order to capture individual variation in social cognition? Objective, standardized tasks should be the goal so that a quantitative comparison between individuals becomes possible (\citeproc{ref-schaafsma2015deconstructing}{Schaafsma et al., 2015}). As we have seen, a classical developmental research question concerns whether child development happens in stages or in a continuous way (\citeproc{ref-parnes2022infant}{Parnes \& Pagano, 2022}). To answer this (dis)continuity question, we need continuous, as opposed to dichotomous, (A) experimental manipulations and (B) outcome measures (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}). A continuous experimental manipulation could include several levels of trial/item difficulty and, for example, depict gradual mental states (e.g., differing degrees of knowledge). This might help to move beyond studying the age of first emergence and capture more qualitative differences in social-cognitive development (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{Slaughter \& Repacholi, 2003}). A continuous outcome measure could, for example, include reaction times, looking behavior, or accuracy in fine-grained action responses. This would have several advantages. First, continuous outcome measures leave room in which individuals can vary (\citeproc{ref-hutchins2008false}{Hutchins et al., 2008}; \citeproc{ref-schaafsma2015deconstructing}{Schaafsma et al., 2015}). Second, it could prevent floor- and ceiling effects in which a considerable percentage of participants cluster around the minimum or maximum available score. Third, this might, in turn, enable including older children and adults in the sample and getting a more accurate and complete picture of social-cognitive developmental pathways (\citeproc{ref-hutchins2008false}{Hutchins et al., 2008}; \citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{Slaughter \& Repacholi, 2003}).

Importantly, a task's psychometric properties need to be examined to test whether variation between participants is genuine or due to arbitrary external factors. Robust methods would show satisfactory validity and reliability estimates (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{Fu et al., 2023}). Presenting more than one trial per child (or, in the best case, as many as possible) would increase the precision with which we can estimate a participant's ability level. Additionally, the task could capture more possible response patterns which leads to a better differentiation between individuals (\citeproc{ref-bohn2024understanding}{Bohn et al., 2024}). Simultaneously, task duration should be kept brief to allow for large sample sizes (especially important for individual differences) (\citeproc{ref-molleman2019unleashing}{Molleman et al., 2019}).

Regarding the construct(s) that a task measures, researchers have argued for including more diverse mental states and not falling into the common pitfall to only test for \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{Beaudoin et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{Fu et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-heise2023psychometric}{Heise, 2023}; \citeproc{ref-hiller2014validity}{Hiller et al., 2014}). Processing demands need to be kept in mind when designing new tasks so that children's social-cognitive abilities are not masked by extraneous factors (\citeproc{ref-setoh2016twoandahalfyearolds}{Setoh et al., 2016}). Instead of artificial experimental setups with academic test questions leading to potential pragmatic confusion (\citeproc{ref-oktay-gur2017children}{Oktay-Gür \& Rakoczy, 2017}; \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2020young}{Rakoczy \& Oktay-Gür, 2020}), new tasks should aim to measure how children genuinely apply social cognition within contexts that resemble everyday-life situations (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{Slaughter \& Repacholi, 2003}). Fu et al. (\citeproc{ref-fu2023systematicb}{2023}) have recommended that \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks should include visual stimuli, such as pictures or videos, and response formats with little language demands to aid children's task understanding and language processing.

Methodological advancements do not lead anywhere if they are not shared within the scientific community. Elson et al. (\citeproc{ref-elson2023psychological}{2023}) have argued that psychological tasks are often used only a handful of times --- namely by the same researcher(s) who designed the task. The reluctance to share own tasks and re-use tasks of other researchers hinders cumulative science. As the authors figuratively pointed out, ``psychological measures aren't toothbrushes'' (\citeproc{ref-elson2023psychological}{Elson et al., 2023, p. 1}). Therefore, Elson and colleagues call for more transparency and standardization in the psychological tasks we implement and apply. Open science principles will help other researchers to reproduce study results, test their generalizability, and eventually address issues related to the replicability crisis in (developmental) psychology (\citeproc{ref-opensciencecollaboration2015estimating}{OpenScienceCollaboration, 2015}; \citeproc{ref-sen2024methodological}{Sen \& Gredebäck, 2024}; \citeproc{ref-syed2021reproducibility}{Syed, 2021}).

For studying the variability or universality of our core social-cognitive abilities across communities, studies need to stop oversampling participants from the Global North and include more diverse communities (\citeproc{ref-arnett2008neglecteda}{Arnett, 2008}; \citeproc{ref-henrich2010weirdesta}{Henrich et al., 2010}; \citeproc{ref-krys2024weirda}{Krys et al., 2024}; \citeproc{ref-lillard1998ethnopsychologies}{Lillard, 1998}). In developmental psychology, a cross-cultural perspective will enable us to study how children's early life experiences structure their core cognitive abilities (\citeproc{ref-amir2020crosscultural}{Amir \& McAuliffe, 2020}; \citeproc{ref-broesch2023roadmap}{Broesch et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-liebal2018crosscultural}{Liebal \& Haun, 2018}). In order to include more communities, tasks need to be adaptable to different languages and superficial stimulus appearances (\citeproc{ref-bourdage2023evaluation}{Bourdage et al., 2023}). Furthermore, reliability and validity estimates of a task should be verified in every community as these psychometric properties cannot be generalized from one community to another (\citeproc{ref-bourdage2023evaluation}{Bourdage et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-hajduk2020how}{Hajdúk et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-waschl2022crosscultural}{Waschl \& Chen, 2022}).

As I have argued, the field of developmental psychology would benefit from establishing new tasks to capture individual- and community-level variability in social cognition. The present dissertation aims to implement this paradigm shift and showcases an example of how methodological advancement in this area might be possible. The construct that we will be focusing on is one of our core social-cognitive abilities: gaze following. In the following chapter, I will outline the aims and approaches of the included studies in greater detail.

\chapter{General Approach}\label{approach}

\section{Aims of this Dissertation}\label{aims-general}

The overarching aim of this dissertation is to deepen our understanding of variability in a core social-cognitive ability, namely gaze following. In the \hyperref[introduction]{Introduction}, I have highlighted calls for better (\emph{i.e.,} valid, reliable, generalizable) social cognition tasks. The projects included in this dissertation follow this call --- and try to demonstrate that, even if demanding, methodological advancement is feasible. By focusing on an individual differences measure, this dissertation aims to question the conception that variation between participants equals noise and should be disregarded. By applying the newly designed gaze following task, I hope to show-case how individual differences research on social cognition helps us to answer fundamental questions about the development, cognitive processes and universality of human's extraordinary social-cognitive abilities. In the following, I will outline the role that each of the four included studies play in reaching these overall objectives.

\subsection{Aims of Study I}\label{aims-studyI}

Much of the existing social cognition research relies on study designs that were created for group-level analyses. Yet, many research questions focus on individual differences. For example, do siblings have a positive influence on children's social-cognitive development (\citeproc{ref-devine2018family}{Devine \& Hughes, 2018}; \citeproc{ref-perner1994theory}{Perner et al., 1994}; \citeproc{ref-peterson2000kindred}{Peterson, 2000}; \citeproc{ref-stewart1983sibling}{Stewart, 1983})? How are gaze following and language abilities related (\citeproc{ref-brooks2005development}{Brooks \& Meltzoff, 2005}, \citeproc{ref-brooks2015connecting}{2015}; \citeproc{ref-macdonald2013eye}{Macdonald \& Tatler, 2013}; \citeproc{ref-okumura2017individual}{Okumura et al., 2017})? Can a child be trained to improve their perspective-taking ability (\citeproc{ref-lecce2014promoting}{Lecce et al., 2014}; \citeproc{ref-ruffman2018variety}{Ruffman et al., 2018}; \citeproc{ref-zhang2021worse}{Zhang et al., 2021})?

In order to relate cognitive abilities and external factors to each other, social cognition tasks need to be able to measure differences between children (or within children over a certain period of time). Tasks that are designed to do so remain rare. This study aimed at approaching this issue and described the development and validation of our new gaze following task, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{Task for Assessing iNdividual differences in Gaze understanding --- Open (TANGO)}. We have designed a playful study in which participants are asked to locate a balloon. The twist is that the participants cannot see the balloon itself. However, they see how another agent (animal; pig, monkey, sheep) gazes out of a window, into the direction of the balloon. Participants have to follow the agent's gaze to locate the balloon. We designed two task versions: a discrete version in which the balloon was hidden inside a box, and a continuous version in which the balloon was hidden behind a hedge. The box version was generically created in a way that enabled different numbers of boxes (min. 2, max. 8). Participants' gaze following abilities were measured dichotomously (correct/incorrect) in the discrete box version, and continuously in the hedge version, namely as the distance between the actual target's location and their assumed location.

\hyperref[studyI]{Study I} consisted of three main parts. In the first part, we tested the task's usability in a sample of 3- to 5-year-old children and adults. Participants completed the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} in its discrete box version with 5 (for children) or 8 boxes (for adults), or the continous hedge version. We assessed whether the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} captured individual differences and whether data collection mode (\emph{i.e}., remotely vs.~in-person) influenced children's performance. In the second part, we aimed at assessing whether these individual differences were reliable. We repeated data collection two weeks after the initial session and estimated retest-reliability and internal consistency. In the third part, we attempted to gauge the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}'s validity. For its construct validity, we explored the relationship between the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} and variables of children's daily social environment. For its predictive validity, we examined the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}'s relationship with a language task six months later. Together, these studies aimed at thoroughly assessing the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} as a new task to measure individual differences in gaze following.

\subsection{Aims of Study II}\label{aims-studyII}

\hyperref[studyII]{Study II} built upon the results of \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} and adopted the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} to examine three research questions related to individual differences. We aimed at assessing (1) how gaze following develops across the lifespan, (2) how people process gaze cues, and (3) how gaze following relates to other (social-) cognitive abilities.

In attempting to answer the first question, we remotely collected data from 3- to 80-year-olds and examined changes in their ability to follow gaze. While previous gaze following research often focused on the youngest age in which children can follow gaze (\citeproc{ref-dentremont1997demonstration}{D'Entremont et al., 1997}; e.g., \citeproc{ref-dentremont2000perceptual}{D'Entremont, 2000}), we focused on the development (in precision) after this initial milestone.

Second, we developed a computational cognitive model to explain the underlying processes of how people process gaze. We hypothesized that participants observe the pupil location within the eye and calculate gaze vectors that point toward the attentional focus. As this process was likely to be noisy, individual differences were assumed in the participant's uncertainty surrounding this gaze vector. We judged the evidence for this gaze model by comparing it to two alternative explanations of the data: a center bias and a random guessing model. Due to its underlying geometrical features, the gaze model predicted that uncertainties around the gaze vector increased the further an agent looks to the side. We planned to check for this signature pattern in the data by assessing the participants' imprecision levels in each target bin.

Third, we intended to test whether an individual's precision in gaze following related to other (social-) cognitive abilities. Consistent with our gaze model, we assessed whether gaze following was related to non-social vector following. To test this claim, we designed a new vector following task that matched the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} as closely as possible but within a non-social context. The vector following task relied on the concept of magnetism and asked children to locate a magnet based on the location of a gearwheel. Furthermore, we applied four tasks out of a \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} task battery (\citeproc{ref-wellman2001metaanalysis}{Wellman et al., 2001}) and two perspective-taking tasks (\citeproc{ref-flavell1981younga}{Flavell, Everett, et al., 1981}; \citeproc{ref-flavell1981development}{Flavell, Flavell, et al., 1981}). These comparisons aimed at disentangling the components that make up gaze following. In sum, \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} aimed at providing a comprehensive picture of the lifelong development, cognitive processes, and components of gaze following.

\subsection{Aims of Study III}\label{aims-studyIII}

Studies \hyperref[studyI]{I} and \hyperref[studyII]{II} presented above relied on child samples from the Global North (Leipzig, Germany). Traditional developmental theories often assume that central features of social cognition hold universally true across human cultures (\citeproc{ref-wellman2013universal}{Wellman, 2013}). On the other hand, communities vary in how infants are typically carried and how often they interact face-to-face (see \hyperref[intro-gaze-cc]{Introduction}), and thus, we might expect cross-cultural differences in how children determine another's attention and follow gaze (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}). With \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}, we aimed at evaluating the universality and variability of gaze following. To broaden our perspective, we collected data of children's gaze following abilities from 17 diverse communities spanning five different continents. To our knowledge, this attempt constituted the largest international sample on children's gaze following abilities to this date.

We aimed at analyzing the data in three different ways. First, we examined the developmental trajectory of gaze following across communities. Second, we explored whether absolute differences in gaze following imprecision related to variables concerning the data collection mode and/or children's daily environments. Third, we checked whether the signature pattern predicted by our gaze model in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} could be found in all communities studied. With this approach, we aimed to investigate whether the same underlying model could describe the ways in which children worldwide process gaze. All in one, this study intended to provide first evidence for the universality or variability of gaze following across cultures.

\subsection{Aims of Study IV}\label{aims-studyIV}

\hyperref[studyIV]{Study IV} intended to strengthen the basis for using the newly developed gaze following task for cross-cultural research. The paper had three main aims. First, we described the process of designing the cross-cultural gaze following task, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---Cross-Cultural (TANGO---CC)}. We aimed to provide a roadmap for other researchers how to pragmatically develop a new social cognition task that can be used for studying diverse communities.

Second, we provided a tutorial how other researchers can use and customize the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} according to their needs. This section aimed to highlight the components of the task that are constant and those that are variable and can be adapted to diverse languages and communities.

Third (and most importantly), we aimed at examining the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}'s reliability across diverse communities. While the psychometric properties of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} were previously tested in one setting (Leipzig, Germany; \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}), we cannot simply generalize these findings and assume the task's validity and reliability based on a mono-cultural sample. For this purpose, we aimed at further analyzing the data set from \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}. We assessed performance across trial types, within- and between-community variation, and internal consistency measures in all of the 17 communities studied. Together, this study aimed at providing a direction of how researchers can study variation in social cognition at an individual- and community-level.

\section{Research Practices}\label{approach-practices}

In the sections above, I have highlighted the theoretical approaches and aims of the publications included in this dissertation. All of these studies build upon the same underlying testing infrastructure. As this dissertation has a strong focus on methodological advances, I want to outline our main technological decisions within the process of designing this new testing infrastructure. In-depth information regarding each specific study can be found in the corresponding manuscripts in \hyperref[appendixA]{Appendix A}.

\subsection{Accessibility of Study Materials}\label{approach-accessibility}

We strongly adhered to Open Science principles in the construction of our new standardized gaze following task. The projects included in this dissertation pre-registered studies with their planned sample sizes, study procedures and analyses for hypothesis testing before data collection, as well as shared the study materials, analysis scripts and data sets after data collection. This dissertation and its included publications have published all related information in online repositories on GitHub (\mbox{\url{https://github.com}} and the Open Science Framework (\mbox{\url{https://osf.io}}; links leading to specific projects can be found in the respective manuscripts in the \hyperref[appendixA]{Appendix A}).

Articles were written in R Markdown which allowed us to combine continuous text and results of statistical analyses into one coherent document. The aim was to reduce the chances to accidentally copy-paste incorrect or outdated findings into the manuscript. We tracked all analysis scripts and the manuscript texts in a version-controlled manner. This enables other researchers to transparently retrace decisions and changes along the way. The newly implemented task(s) were made openly available to other researchers to use and share as they wish. The source code of the website(s) have also been published on GitHub. By cloning the corresponding repository, motivated researchers can modify and further develop the task to their needs.

As the final project, \hyperref[studyIV]{Study IV} incorporated refinements that have further optimized the usability of the gaze following task. While adapting the source code for cross-cultural stimulus presentation, I have refactored the code base; that is, I have improved the internal structure, readability, and maintainability of the software without altering its behavior or functionality). I have added comments to the code base using JSDoc (\mbox{\url{https://jsdoc.app}}), a markup language developed to document and annotate JavaScript source code files. Furthermore, I have collected frequently asked questions and created a manual for other researchers using the task (\mbox{\url{https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/tango-cc/manual.html}}). Compared to the first version of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}, these changes served to improve the task's sustainability over time.

\subsection{Presentation Mode}\label{approach-presentation}

Before designing the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} itself, we had to choose a presentation mode for the experimental stimuli. Many traditional developmental studies have designed interactive tasks in which children interact with the experimenter or their caregiver. This makes standardization difficult as experimenters (or caregivers) have individual communication styles, might accidentally alter the instruction script due to memory gaps, or need replacement at some point (e.g., when temporary work contracts of research assistants end). In addition, this approach makes scaling data collection difficult as training experimenters requires substantial temporal and financial resources. Since studies investigating individual differences rely on large sample sizes, we decided to take another route. We designed an online testing platform that hosts studies in all common web browsers. It can be accessed on all devices (e.g., laptop, tablet) and does not require prior installation. Even though the task was programmed as a website, it does not require a working WiFi connection (for more information, see \hyperref[approach-programming]{Programming Framework} further down).

The design as an online study has several advantages. First, it allows for maximally standardized procedures as audio instructions are pre-recorded and automated. Second, data does not need to be entered manually or coded from video. Instead, the website stores response times and clicking behavior of participants automatically. This greatly reduces potential coding biases and rater errors. Third, the presentation as a website allows for in-person and remote study participation. Families can choose whether they want to participate by coming to the research lab or kindergartens, or whether they want to participate within the comfort of their own home. In this case, no appointments or rooms in the lab need to be scheduled. The families receive a personalized invitation link and can access the online study whenever and wherever it suits them best. This increases the inclusiveness for families with busy schedules, longer traveling distances to the lab or children who might be shy to interact with strangers. While studies conducted in a research lab might be prone to over-study families with certain characteristics (e.g., families living closer by, having a higher SES or more free time), online studies might make study participation more accessible for a wider range of families --- which, in turn, would increase the representativeness of the sample.

We have consciously chosen to implement an active behavioral task as we wanted to circumvent issues in interpretability of implicit tasks. For example, it is unclear whether looking time measures capture children's level of surprise, attention, memory formation or other cognitive processes, and whether they show convergent validity (\citeproc{ref-aslin2007look}{Aslin, 2007}; \citeproc{ref-dorrenberg2018how}{Dörrenberg et al., 2018}). While our outcome response does not provide a direct measure of underlying cognitive processes, it focuses on children's active behavior which might translate more directly into their actions in daily life.

The task itself is presented as an animated, interactive picture book. Audio instructions guide children through the task and provide a description of the presented events. Trial types build up on each other and familiarize children with the response format.

\subsection{Programming Framework}\label{approach-programming}

The online study was programmed in JavaScript (functionality of the website), HTML (content of the website), CSS (styling of the website) and PHP (server-side interaction for down-/ uploading data). We decided to refrain from using web development frameworks like Next.js or React: as web development is a very fast moving domain with frequently appearing technology advances, projects relying on new frameworks often require regular monitoring. Our goal was to create a durable code base that avoids breaking changes through large updates. Additionally, we aimed at keeping the code base as easily accessible as possible so that researchers with less programming experience can also read through and adjust the code. We reasoned that this could be better achieved by relying on the so-called ``Vanilla JavaScript'' without additional frameworks. An exception to this was the one animation library we used. The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP; \mbox{\url{https://gsap.com}}) is a JavaScript library for industry-standard, high-performance web animations. However, GSAP is widely spread, well documented, and easy to read so including this library rather increased user friendliness.

A module bundler for JavaScript. Parcel (\mbox{\url{https://parceljs.org}}), and, in later projects, webpack (\mbox{\url{https://webpack.js.org}}) tracked modules and dependencies, optimized website performance and enhanced the developer experience (e.g., by enabling a development server and hot reloading). However, please note that these bundlers only alter the source code on the sever-side --- the functions defined in Vanilla JavaScript remained in their human-readable format. During website development, we made use of the development server made available by the module bundler. This means that we could test the website on our local computer and only uploaded content to the web server once the website was fully implemented. The bundler builds a so-called ``dist'' folder that contains all website content in a compressed and optimized format. This folder is essential for both online and offline data collection. For online data collection, the dist folder gets uploaded to the web server and the study can be accessed under its corresponding URL. For offline data collection, a live server can be installed which then hosts the dist folder locally. This is especially practical in settings with unreliable or non-existent WiFi connection: data collection in communities living in remote villages becomes viable. Additionally, this approach is helpful for data collection with children in (German) kindergartens as these institutions often do not have public internet connection or stable telephone reception.

URL parameters were used to create individualized links for participating families. This way, we could pass on information from our participant database to the study website (e.g., age of the children, language of the study, personalized gift vouchers for study compensation).

\subsection{Data Processing}\label{approach-dataprocessing}

After a child completed the task, the website automatically saves all responses and response times. The website stores all click data and, if desired, some additional device information (e.g., touch screen yes/no, what type and version of web browser) in a text format. During initial development and the first published article (see \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}), we used JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files which are commonly used for transmitting data in web applications. In later stages of the project (see \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}), we instead used CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files as these are more commonly used among psychology researchers. In these text files, each trial is represented by one row of data. Columns depict the collected variables; for example, subject id, trial type, target location, and response. If requested, a webcam recording can be captured that films the study participation via the front camera. We implemented this feature especially for remote data collection. If caregivers consented to the webcam use, we could use the webcam recordings to ensure that indeed the children themselves carried out the task and did not get any external help. Depending on the choice of the experimenter and the data collection setup, data could be uploaded to secure servers located within the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, or could be downloaded to the testing device (e.g., tablet or computer).

Data pre-processing was greatly simplified as the study data does not require any further response coding. Individual subject files were merged into one final data set using the programming language R. Data visualization and statistical analyses were conducted within the same program.

\chapter{General Discussion}\label{discussion}

\section{Summary of Results}\label{summary-of-results}

\subsection{Results of Study I}\label{results-studyI}

In \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}, we have examined the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} as a viable task for studying individual differences in gaze following. First, we found the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} to be engaging for young children and adults alike. Participants could complete 15 test trials within five to ten minutes. The presentation as a web-app functioned smoothly across different browsers and devices, and data was reliably uploaded to the servers. Children showed similar developmental trajectories in both versions of the task (\emph{i.e.}, discrete box version, continuous hedge version). While the average three-year-old were still rather imprecise in locating the target (only slightly better than chance in the box version), children became more precise with increasing age. In neither of the versions did the children or adults reach ceiling levels in their performance. We found individual differences across all ages. For example, some of the five-year-old children were more imprecise in their gaze following abilities than the average three-year-old. Data collected remotely without supervision closely resembled those that were collected in person.

Second, excellent psychometric properties underscored that the individual differences captured by the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} were meaningful and could not be ascribed to random noise: High retest reliability estimates proved that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} did not simply capture daily fluctuations but stable ability levels across time. Age-independent \hyperref[acronyms_GLMM]{Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM)}-based estimates (\citeproc{ref-rouder2019psychometrics}{Rouder \& Haaf, 2019}) were higher than the previously estimated \emph{Pearson} correlations. Internal consistency estimates also pointed to the reliability of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} and suggested that participants' performance within one session was not affected by trivial effects like exhaustion or habituation. We found that different splitting and stratification methods previously proposed by Pronk et al. (\citeproc{ref-pronk2022methods}{2022}) let to similar or even higher internal consistency estimates.

Third, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}'s validity was established by probing correlations between gaze following and concepts considered to be theoretically associated: social interactions and language abilities. Children who entered daycare at a comparably older age than their peers were more likely to be imprecise in gaze following. Although the other social interaction proxies (e.g., number and age of siblings) did not improve the model fit, the results pointed into the expected direction: the more opportunities for social interactions a child had, the more precise they were in gaze following. Additionally, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} was predictive of children's receptive vocabulary (as measured by the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{open Receptive Vocabulary task (oREV)}) six months later, even when correcting for age.

Taken together, \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} established the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} as a reliable and valid individual differences measure of gaze following.

\subsection{Results of Study II}\label{results-studyII}

\hyperref[studyII]{Study II} showed an exemplary way how the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} (in its continuous version) can be used to answer research questions on individual differences in gaze following. First, we found that precision in gaze following develops throughout the lifespan. Childhood was characterized by rapid changes in which children' imprecision levels in gaze following were more than halved. During early adulthood, participants were most precise in their gaze following abilities, and toward older age, precision levels slightly decreased again. Individuals differed from each other in all age groups.

Second, a cognitive model was designed to interpret individual differences in gaze following in a psychologically meaningful way. The proposed process model aimed to depict how participants infer the agent's attentional focus in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}. It assumed that participants estimate the centers of the agent's eyeball and pupil and connect those as a gaze vector (\emph{i.e.}, line-of-sight). The pupil angle, respectively, is the angle between this gaze vector and a vector pointing horizontally to the ground. Participants were assumed to integrate the information of the pupil angles (and gaze vectors) from the left and right eye. The point at which both gaze vectors meet defined the attentional focus of the agent. Estimating the pupil angles was assumed to be a noisy process. This was modeled as participants sampling estimated pupil angles from a probability distribution which was shaped by multiplying two Normal distributions centered on the true pupil angles with equal variance. Individual differences were modeled by differing degrees of uncertainty around the pupil angle (\emph{i.e.}, the variance representing the width of the distribution). The development (or refinement) of gaze following was conceptualized as a decrease in uncertainty around the pupil angles which would result in less imprecision in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}. The characteristics of the probability distribution described above resulted in the following prediction: When the agent gazed towards the side, the distribution from which the participants sampled was wider compared to when the agent gazed centrally to the ground (see Figure 2 in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}). Therefore, participants should be more imprecise for target locations further out.

The results provided substantial evidence for the proposed gaze model. In the child as well as the adult sample, the gaze model estimates correlated strongly with the data mean. Participants' imprecision levels across target bins resembled a U-shape, which matched the prediction of the gaze model: targets on the very left- or right-hand side led to the highest imprecision levels, while center targets led to a decrease in imprecision. Compared to two alternative models that explained the data by a center bias or random guessing, the gaze model was clearly favored.

As became evident, the gaze model described gaze following as a social form of vector following. We tested this proposed relationship experimentally and found that gaze following correlated moderately with a non-social vector following task. Additionally, gaze following was related to two perspective-taking tasks (\citeproc{ref-flavell1981younga}{Flavell, Everett, et al., 1981}; \citeproc{ref-flavell1981development}{Flavell, Flavell, et al., 1981}) but not with other \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks (\citeproc{ref-wellman2001metaanalysis}{Wellman et al., 2001}). This suggests that gaze following comprises estimations of vectors in space as well as evaluating another person's point of view.

In sum, \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} illustrated the continuing development of accurately interpreting another's gaze direction, along with the cognitive processes behind this ability.

\subsection{Results of Study III}\label{results-studyIII}

Developmental theories often (implicitly) assume that social-cognitive abilities develop and function in the same way across human cultures. In \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}, we experimentally tested this claim: While \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} and \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} relied on child samples from one specific community in the Global North (Leipzig, Germany), \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III} assessed gaze following in children from diverse rural and urban communities on five different continents.

First, we found that children across the 17 studied communities got substantially more precise in gaze following with increasing age. A model that assumed cross-cultural variation in average performance and in the developmental trajectories performed better than simpler models. Nevertheless, individuals did not cluster by community which was shown by largely overlapping distributions. Individual differences were found between all age groups and communities.

Second, we found that the gaze model proposed in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} was applicable to every studied community. Matching the model prediction, children across all communities were more precise in locating the attentional focus of the agent when they gazed centrally compared to sideways. A model comparison with the center bias and random guessing models revealed overwhelming support for the gaze model.

Third, absolute differences in gaze following precision could be partially explained by the data collection method. Children with no access to touchscreens were found to be less precise in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}. Yet, individual differences were still present in communities where 100\% of children had access to touchscreens. Similar to \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}, we predicted that children with relatively more opportunities for social interaction within one community would show higher levels of gaze following precision. However, we did not find any evidence for a relationship between gaze following and the collected demographic variables (e.g., size of household, number of children).

Overall, the findings of \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III} suggested that children from diverse communities were remarkably consistent in the way they processed gaze, while individual differences were found everywhere.

\subsection{Results of Study IV}\label{results-studyIV}

As \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III} relied on participants from diverse communities, the continuous version of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} was further developed into the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} by exchanging the animal stimuli for human stimuli and including 13 new instruction languages. \hyperref[studyIV]{Study IV} described the design process of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} and examined the psychometric grounds for its use in cross-cultural data collection. For this purpose, we re-used the data set of \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}.

First, we provided a roadmap to our pragmatic approach to task development (thoroughly assessing psychometrics of the basic \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} version in a German setting (see \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}), while already working on the cross-cultural stimulus development and selection). The importance and added value of collaborating with local researchers and assistants was established for creating the new stimulus set. The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}'s web-app implementation proved highly useful in adapting the stimuli and enabling a swift data collection. Children from all over the world felt comfortable participating in the tablet study, irregardless of whether they had previous touchscreen experience or not, and the extensive data set of \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III} proved the feasibility of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} for cross-cultural data collection.

Second, the manuscript visualized the customizable components of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}. We featured a tutorial for how other researchers interested in using the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} can adjust the task to their needs.

Third, and most prominently, we established the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}'s psychometrics across communities. Children from all communities performed best in training trials compared to test trials. Variation within communities (\emph{i.e.}, individual differences) greatly outweighed variation between communities. Split-half reliability estimates calculated following three different approaches ((1) simple odd-even split, (2) a stratification by target centrality, and (3) a model-based age correction in addition to the stratification) yielded similar results and speak for a high internal consistency across different communities.

Altogether, these findings underline the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}'s suitability to study the development of gaze following across individuals and communities.

\section{Research Contributions}\label{contributions}

The projects included in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of child development from two different perspectives: (1) by extending our knowledge about meaningful variation in a core social-cognitive ability, and (2) by providing modern, valid, reliable, and generalizable open-access tasks to other researchers. I will begin by first considering the theoretical aspects before moving on to the methodological aspects.

\subsection{Theoretical Contributions}\label{contributions-theory}

Our newly developed gaze following task, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC), has enabled us to study variation in one of the most fundamental social-cognitive abilities. We have focused on (1) the lifelong development of gaze following, (2) a mechanistic explanation of the cognitive processes behind it, (3) the relationship with other (social-) cognitive abilities (vector following, \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM}, language), and (4) the universality of gaze following.

A large body of research has investigated the emergence of gaze following in infancy (for review, see Del Bianco et al. (\citeproc{ref-delbianco2019developmental}{2019})). Yet, little was known about the further development once certain qualitative milestones (e.g., following gaze behind barriers or to locations behind themselves, (\citeproc{ref-butterworth1991minds}{Butterworth \& Jarrett, 1991}; \citeproc{ref-corkum1995development}{Corkum \& Moore, 1995}; \citeproc{ref-deak2000effects}{Deák et al., 2000}; \citeproc{ref-moll200412}{Moll \& Tomasello, 2004})) are reached. We could show that the precision to locate another's attentional focus does indeed increase until adolescence. By conducting \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} across the lifespan, we could identify the shape of change in gaze following: a rapid improvement in early childhood with a followed sequence of stability in adulthood (with slight decline toward old age). This underlines that gaze following --- like probably many other (social-) cognitive abilities (e.g., \citeproc{ref-raviv2018developmental}{Raviv \& Arnon, 2018}) --- continues to develop after its initial emergence in infancy. This fits to the fact that \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} abilities can differ into adulthood and follow a U shape in their developmental trajectory (\citeproc{ref-henry2013metaanalyticb}{Henry et al., 2013}; \citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}). While the earliest instance of a social-cognitive ability might be informative for the pre-requisites for this ability, studying its further development helps to illuminate where and why individuals differ from each other. At some point, the huge majority of children will pass a dichotomous pass-or-fail test of gaze following. And yet, these children differ in their competencies around social cognition and social interaction. Focusing on the refinement of social-cognitive abilities will help us to find out the underlying causes for diverse real-life outcomes.

We have proposed a tool for interpreting individual differences in gaze following, specifically in the form of a computational cognitive model. While existing theories have visualized gaze following as tracing a line of sight (\citeproc{ref-anstis1969perception}{Anstis et al., 1969}; \citeproc{ref-symons2004you}{Symons et al., 2004}; \citeproc{ref-todorovic2006geometrical}{Todorović, 2006}; \citeproc{ref-yaniv1990heuristics}{Yaniv \& Shatz, 1990}), we have formulated this idea as a testable, well-defined mathematical model with explicit assumptions. Most importantly, we have included a conceptualization of individual differences. Our model assumes that individuals differ in their uncertainty around estimated pupil angles. This formulation also helps us to conceive development, namely as a reduction in the uncertainty around the pupil angles. The gaze model makes interesting group-level predictions. We could confirm that the distance between the agent and their focus of attention (or, in other words, the centrality) does indeed influence people's precision in gaze following. A carefully designed, matched non-social vector following task correlated with gaze following, which highlights the importance of vector estimation in gaze following. This finding fits well with other research that underlines the spatial mechanisms in joint attention (\citeproc{ref-butterworth1991minds}{Butterworth \& Jarrett, 1991}), and pointing (\citeproc{ref-omadagain2019origin}{O'Madagain et al., 2019}), highlighting the relevance of vector estimation in other areas of social cognition.

Developmental theories often highlight the importance of social interactions in children's social-cognitive development (e.g., \citeproc{ref-vygotsky1962thought}{Vygotsky, 1962}, \citeproc{ref-vygotsky1978mind}{1978}, \citeproc{ref-vygotsky1987thinking}{1987}). Opportunities to observe, play, fight, and communicate with others should highlight their unique mental states which, in turn, facilitates the development of \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} and social cognition (\citeproc{ref-perner1994theory}{Perner et al., 1994}; \citeproc{ref-peterson2000kindred}{Peterson, 2000}; \citeproc{ref-zhang2021worse}{Zhang et al., 2021}). \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} and \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} contribute to this body of research. In a German sample, weak positive relationships between gaze following and demographic predictors like age of childcare entry pointed into the same direction.

Related to this is the question if and how gaze following and perspective-taking are connected (\citeproc{ref-astor2022gaze}{Astor \& Gredebäck, 2022}). We could show that children's visual perspective-taking abilities predicted their imprecision levels in gaze following. Interestingly, other \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks did not relate to gaze following. We proposed that the cognitive processes underlying gaze following and perspective-taking overlap as both abilities require taking into account another person's point of view. While other \hyperref[acronyms_ToM]{ToM} tasks often rely on this component as well, they might entail more complex meta-representational aspects. For example, this could be an understanding that mental states can be false or aspectual in nature (\citeproc{ref-rakoczy2022foundations}{Rakoczy, 2022}) --- concepts that are both not required for gaze following or visual perspective-taking.

A wide-spread notion is that gaze following supports language acquisition: children are assumed to follow gaze to identify the referent of a new word (\citeproc{ref-bohn2022predicting}{Bohn et al., 2022}; \citeproc{ref-delbianco2019developmental}{Del Bianco et al., 2019}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello2003constructing}{Tomasello, 2003}). For example, Brooks \& Meltzoff (\citeproc{ref-brooks2005development}{2005}) found that infant's gaze following abilities predicted their language comprehension half a year later. Nevertheless, Astor \& Gredebäck (\citeproc{ref-astor2022gaze}{2022}) have argued that the relationship between language and gaze following remains inconclusive as a substantial amount of studies reported mixed evidence (see Figure 3 in Astor \& Gredebäck (\citeproc{ref-astor2022gaze}{2022})), lack statistical power or combine gaze and point following into composite measures. We addressed these issues by specifically focusing on isolated gaze following and leveraging a large data set to increase statistical power. Indeed, imprecision in preschool children's gaze following proved to be a substantial predictor for their receptive vocabulary six months later. This result helps to conclusively settle the research question on the relationship between gaze following and language development.

Coming back to the cognitive gaze model, the proposed model has demonstrated its relevance in cross-cultural research. We found slight differences across communities in the absolute precision in children's gaze following. Had we simply compared those absolute values, we might have interpreted the findings in a way that eye gaze is processed differently across communities. Already Innis \& Staddon (\citeproc{ref-innis1989should}{1989}) have pointed out that ``different performance patterns cannot be taken as evidence for different underlying mechanisms. And, symmetrically, similar performance cannot be taken as evidence for similar mechanisms'' (p.~155). Consequently, they have argued for defining the formal mechanisms that regulate and describe behavior. By applying the gaze model and checking for its predicted signature patterns in the data, we could move away from the surface-level comparison and indeed found evidence that children worldwide process gaze in similar ways even though they differed in their certainty around the true pupil angles. Indeed, the gaze model might provide a framework understanding of how social cognition might be universal and yet vary --- a leading example to explain how ``All people everywhere are different, \emph{and} all people everywhere are the same'' (\citeproc{ref-wellman2013universal}{Wellman, 2013, p. 69}).

Taken together, the included studies underline the added value of assessing variation in social cognition and show examplary ways in which research questions benefit from an individual differences measure. To go further, measuring an individual's social-cognitive ability might be even more relevant in clinical or education settings in which practitioners might want to assess and support a child's unique development.

\subsection{Methodological Contributions}\label{contributions-methods}

After having considered how the presented studies have deepened our theoretical knowledge of variation in social cognition, or, more specifically, gaze following, let us now turn to the methodological contributions of this work.

Beaudoin et al. (\citeproc{ref-beaudoin2020systematic}{2020}) have argued that finding appropriate social-cognitive tasks for children remains difficult: Few tasks measure the ability in question in a continuous way and/or report empirically validated psychometric information. To solve the first issue, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} exists in a categorical and continuous version which increases the flexibility for other interested researchers. Importantly, continuous here means that the experimental manipulation as well as the outcome measure are designed in a continuous format. To tackle the second challenge, we have provided a detailed psychometric analysis of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} by assessing its validity, internal consistency, and retest reliability. Importantly, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} addressed the often declared need for new tasks to assess social cognition across diverse communities. Satisfactory internal consistency estimates across 17 communities show that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} is a reliable cross-cultural gaze following measure. In comparison to traditional gaze following tasks (e.g., \citeproc{ref-astor2020social}{Astor et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-byers-heinlein2021development}{Byers-Heinlein et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-gredeback2010development}{Gredebäck et al., 2010}; \citeproc{ref-ishikawa2022physiological}{Ishikawa et al., 2022}), the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) isolates eye movement alone and removes potential confounds with simultaneous head movements.

We have openly shared the stimulus pool and the source code of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC). First, we hope this inspires other researchers to re-use the materials in their own projects. Especially the collection of cartoon-like human faces might prove helpful in designing new social cognition tasks that can be adapted for cross-cultural data collection. An exploratory analysis (see Supplements \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}) indicated that superficial stimulus modifications, such as using animal faces versus cartoon human faces, did not affect children's task performance. Second, we count on other researchers to follow this example and share their own materials according to Open Science principles. Providing psychometric information of a newly designed task and making it openly accessible will hopefully help to circumvent the ``toothbrush problem'' (\citeproc{ref-elson2023psychological}{Elson et al., 2023}) --- namely that researchers are reluctant to re-use tasks of other scientists.

The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}'s code base could be recycled by other researchers to adapt the testing infrastructure for future tasks. It proved to be a very useful tool for collecting data at scale. The COVID-19 pandemic underlined the importance of flexible data collection strategies. The finding that in-person and remote data collection with the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} yielded similar results (see \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}) justifies the advance of new online methods and adds to the growing body of literature in this domain (\citeproc{ref-bohn2021children}{Bohn, Le, et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-bohn2021how}{Bohn, Tessler, et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-frank2016using}{Frank et al., 2016}).

Two additional tasks that emerged as side projects in the context of this dissertation (see \hyperref[appendixB]{Appendix B}) were designed under the same development principles and operated on very similar data collection platforms: the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV}, and the \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{Parent Report of Expressive Vocabulary in Children (PREVIC)}. The \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV} is a child-directed measure. The task presents participants with four pictures, that is, one target and three distractors (phonological, semantic, and unrelated). A verbal prompt then asks participants to select the target. The initially larger item pool of the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV} included all 30 items of the \hyperref[acronyms_CLT]{Cross-linguistic Lexical Task (CLT)} (\citeproc{ref-haman2015designinga}{Haman et al., 2015}) and added 20 additional items to increase the task's difficulty and avoid ceiling effects for older children. By using \hyperref[acronyms_IRT]{IRT}-modeling based on item difficulty and discrimination, the final item pool of the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV} could be decreased to 22 items. With regard to reliability, stability, convergent and discriminant validity, the final task exhibits exceptional psychometric qualities in a German sample. To complement the picture of children's language development, the \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{PREVIC} serves as a parent-directed measure. The task presents caregivers with a list of words and asked them which of these words their child has already spoken. Similarly to the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV}, the \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{PREVIC} initially consisted of a larger item pool of 379 words. By leveraging the advantages of \hyperref[acronyms_IRT]{IRT}, we were able to create two task versions: a standardized version with a fixed number of 89 words, and an adaptive version which reduces the number of words based on the caregiver input while maintaining measurement accuracy. The \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{PREVIC} shows highly reliable results and convergent validity in a German sample. Up to this day, both tasks, the \hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV} and the \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{PREVIC}, are available only in German. However, the construction and implementation of the testing infrastructure will ease further adaptations to different languages. Furthermore, the web app platform greatly simplified collected large data sets (\hyperref[acronyms_oREV]{oREV}: \emph{N} = 581, \hyperref[acronyms_PREVIC]{PREVIC}: \emph{N} = 1190) which is essential for an \hyperref[acronyms_IRT]{IRT}-based task construction. These two tasks show the benefit of re-using the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC)'s testing infrastructure.

The web-app implementation might tackle another challenge of child research: Developmental studies often report high number of drop-out rates, for example because of children's fuzziness, fatigue or lack of motivation (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2007participant}{Slaughter \& Suddendorf, 2007}). Administering the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} has proven very helpful in this regard: across communities, children tended to complete the task with ease and joy, and often even asked for a repetition. Not only did this allow for a large number of trials per child, but it also meant that drop-out rates could be greatly reduced. Allen et al. (\citeproc{ref-allen2024using}{2024}) have recently promoted games as intuitive, rewarding, engineered research environments. The authors have argued that online games enable studying various domains of cognition with the potential of higher ecological validity, increased participant diversity, cross-cultural suitability and adaptability, and large-scale data sets. Our self-made, game-like design of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) leverages these advantages while retaining maximum experimental control.

The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC)'s task design enabled a large-scale cross-cultural data collection. Adopting study designs for cross-cultural research is often time-consuming and, therefore, done for each community separately (e.g., \citeproc{ref-mehta2011validation}{Mehta et al., 2011}). The modular structure of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} eases this process by providing customizable building blocks. Task instructions are embedded as pre-recorded audio files. This way, the training of the experimenters can be streamlined and there is little room for error by the experimenters. Without these features, we could not have collected data of more than a thousand children across five different continents within a time frame of 22 months.

Finally, we want to highlight the diversity of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} data set from \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}. Participants lived in various kinds of social, cultural, political, and ecological systems, using different languages and subsistence styles. Previous cross-cultural research has often focused on comparing communities from the urban Global North to communities from the rural Global South (\citeproc{ref-barrett2020cognitive}{Barrett, 2020}). We overcame this common pitfall of a dichotomous comparison by providing a more complete, more inclusive picture of the different environments in which children grow up.

\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}

While the studies included in this dissertation have shown their strengths and unique research contributions, they need to be considered against some limitations.

First of all, I want to draw attention to the modification in terminology. While \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} has stated that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} measures \emph{gaze understanding}, we have switched to the term \emph{gaze following} in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}, \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}, and \hyperref[studyIV]{Study IV}. We have defined gaze understanding as ``the ability to locate and use the attentional focus of an agent'' (\citeproc{ref-prein2024tango}{Prein, Kalinke, et al., 2024, p. 2471}), and gaze following as ``turning one's eyes in the same direction as the gaze of another agent'' (\citeproc{ref-prein2024tango}{Prein, Kalinke, et al., 2024, p. 2471}) or as ``the ability to identify the attentional focus of another agent'' (\citeproc{ref-prein2024measuring}{Prein, Bednarski, et al., 2024, p. 9}). In \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}, we have argued that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}'s pre-requisite is gaze following and that it not only includes this component but also an action toward the gazed-at location (\emph{i.e.,} clicking at the target location) which would resemble real-life situations in which we apply social information to advise our own behavior. However, a reviewer of \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} questioned whether the term ``gaze understanding'' appropriately captures the construct that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} measures. They argued that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} mainly involves estimating gaze directions, and the cognitive and perceptual underpinnings remain unclear. The phrase ``understanding'' might overestimate children's ability and might imply a more representational processing than is actually needed for or measured by the task itself. Consequently, we have adopted the term gaze following, which is more consistent with the existing literature and does not suggest any representational processing or conceptual understanding.

Regarding the task design, it might be questioned whether the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) is ``social enough''. As \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} showed, participants' performance in the task related to a moderate degree to their ability to estimate (non-social) vectors in space. Some scholars might question whether tasks can still be considered to measure social cognition if they rely on physical cognition abilities. I would argue that most (if not all) social-cognitive abilities comprise skills from other domains. For example, consider the classical \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} Sally-Anne change-of-location task (\citeproc{ref-baron-cohen1985does}{Baron-Cohen et al., 1985}; \citeproc{ref-wimmer1983beliefs}{Wimmer \& Perner, 1983}). Here, participants need a certain level of object permanence (\emph{i.e.,} understanding that the ball continues to exist in the box even when it cannot be seen) and causality understanding (\emph{i.e.}, moving a ball has consequences for where it is located) to pass the task. Social cognition might, in general, rely on some physical-cognitive abilities --- as Butterworth \& Jarrett (\citeproc{ref-butterworth1991minds}{1991}) said: ````What minds have in common is space'' (p.~55).

Stimuli of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) are presented on a screen and participants do not actively engage in a participatory social interaction. Researchers have pointed out that we may process social information differently when we interact directly with others than when we simply observe them (\citeproc{ref-risko2012social}{Risko et al., 2012}; \citeproc{ref-schilbach2013secondperson}{Schilbach et al., 2013}). Slaughter \& Repacholi (\citeproc{ref-slaughter2003introduction}{2003}) have argued for differentiating between competence (\emph{i.e.,} how an individual responds to social-cognitive tasks in a laboratory setting) and performance (\emph{i.e.,} how an individual applies social-cognitive abilities to contexts in their day-to-day life). We cannot be certain that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) qualifies to measure children's daily performance in gaze following. Yet, first evidence points into the direction that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} taps into real-life social cognition. Children's perspective-taking abilities were related to imprecision in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} but less so to a matched, non-social vector following task. Additionally, the relationship to family-level demographics (e.g., age of childcare entry) suggests that the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} captures a social aspect of children's development.

The proposed cognitive model of gaze following estimates an inference parameter that describes participants' uncertainty around the true pupil angles. While the model gained substantial evidence, the risk of oversimplification exists: potentially, we have missed other parameters that comprise gaze following or explain the performance in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}. For example, a motor noise parameter could be helpful to model how accurately participants click on the location that they wanted to click. In addition, the conducted model comparisons (against a center bias and random guessing model) might profit from more complex alternative models. We have suggested a line-of-sight approach with and without motor noise in the Supplementary materials of \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}. While these can explain how participants solve the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}, they do not model individual differences in participants' inferential abilities and do not recover the U-shaped pattern as predicted by the gaze model and as found in the data. Competitive, realistic alternative models to our gaze model remain to be established. Finally, the proposed gaze model cannot explain whether the development of increasingly precise gaze following (\emph{i.e.}, the decrease in imprecision in the task performance, and the decrease in uncertainty around the pupil angles in the model) appears due to physical, cognitive, or emotional changes. Physical changes might include a maturation in visual acuity (though unlikely for pre-school children), cognitive changes might include a greater sensitivity to social information or an increased comprehension that eye gaze can be used as a cue, and emotional changes might include a higher motivation to focus on other agents as children get older. These and many other factors could drive the refinement of gaze following precision, are mutually compatible with the proposed gaze model, and need further examination.

The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} allowed us to employ the same study design from early childhood into late adulthood, which eases a direct quantitative comparison of the data. Yet, applying the same study design does not necessarily entail that it captures the same underlying constructs in all age groups. Longitudinal or developmental measurement invariance means that a task validly measures the target phenomenon at different ages, so that it is both valid at each age and comparable across ages (\citeproc{ref-skinner2019developmental}{Skinner et al., 2019}). Factors like familiarity with the data collection method or stimuli might influence participants' performance in a task (cf.~effect of touchscreen experience in \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}). While the developmental trajectory found in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} suggests that participants with older age had no issues completing the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}, future studies should further investigate its longitudinal/developmental measure invariance (\citeproc{ref-petersen2023reexamining}{Petersen, 2023}).

Children with no prior touchscreen access showed slightly larger imprecision levels in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC). These technology effects remain important to keep in mind when applying the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} and interpreting the results across communities. Noticeably, communities in which all children had access to touchscreens still showed individual differences. This underlines that not all variation can be attributed to different levels of technology exposure. Additional variables that could predict children's performance in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} need to be examined.

The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC} was designed with constant input of local collaborators. Nevertheless, the original brainstorming, organization and implementation process was mainly based in Leipzig, Germany. Cross-cultural research would benefit from even more community-based, participatory, decolonized methods development throughout all stages of the research process (\citeproc{ref-bermudez2016decolonizing}{Bermúdez et al., 2016}; \citeproc{ref-grant2022decolonizing}{Grant et al., 2022}; \citeproc{ref-stanton2014crossing}{Stanton, 2014}).

\section{Outlook}\label{outlook}

There remain many interesting research avenues that would benefit from an individual differences perspective on social cognition. I will first focus on those that could be studied by modifying the current version of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC), and then move on to broader, more theoretical research questions.

\subsection{Possible Spin-offs of the TANGO}\label{outlook-spinoffs}

The modular structure of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) enables swift modifications of the stimuli and experimental design. Here, I provide first ideas how to apply, modify and extend the task to answer new research questions around gaze following or other related constructs.

Initially, we developed two task versions of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}, with one discrete and one continuous outcome measure (see \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}). The studies that followed (see \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}, \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}, and \hyperref[studyIV]{Study IV}) all relied on the continuous task version. While the continuous version of the task shows slightly better psychometric properties (especially with regards to internal consistency, see \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}), the discrete version of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} might be more helpful for some research questions. First, it is noteworthy that the task difficulty can be easily adjusted by varying the number of boxes between two and eight. With some additional programming efforts, the box version could be turned into an adaptive testing setup: participants could start with a small number of boxes and once they succeed in a given trial, the difficulty is adjusted and more boxes are shown. This might be helpful for implementing a training intervention or studying children's learning curves in gaze following. Second, the boxes in the discrete version could be modified into different colors or forefronts. The appearance of the boxes could be matched to some feature of the agent: for example, a monkey and a box with a banana sticker in the front, or a girl wearing blue shorts and t-shirt with a blue box. Phenomena such as group identity, prior knowledge, or diverse desires could be studied in this way. Another example could be action prediction, that is, the question whether children could anticipate to which box an agent would gaze toward depending on some characteristical feature of the agent.

The youngest participants in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} (especially the three-year-olds) showed high levels of imprecision in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}. This might be due to the subtle gaze cues. Existing studies found that already three- to four-month-olds can follow gaze following to one out of two target objects when a simultaneous head- and eye-movement is presented (e.g., \citeproc{ref-dentremont1997demonstration}{D'Entremont et al., 1997}). The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) could be adapted to include a head movement of the agent. Comparing the task with and without head movement would allow us to disentangle the importance/saliency of both components (eyes, head) for children's precision in locating an attentional focus.

Alternatively, younger children might have been less precise (see \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}) because they were less intrinsically motivated than older participants or did not understand that precision is the task's goal. The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) could be modified to include rewards depending on a child's precision level. For example, a rewarding tune or video clip could be played. The presentation of the tune/video could become longer the more precise a child located the target. This design might (1) increase children's motivation to be precise, (2) help to keep children engaged in the task, and (3) provide a measure of children's potential learning curve in gaze following (comparing earlier with later trials). The task instructions could, furthermore, highlight that participants can take their time until they are confident in their choice. This could reduce a potential confound between faster response times and higher imprecision levels (speed-accuracy trade-off (\citeproc{ref-zaal2005developmental}{Zaal \& Thelen, 2005}); however, in an exploratory analysis, no relationship between response time and imprecision in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} was found).

In the \hyperref[limitations]{Limitations section} I have discussed whether the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) is ``social enough''. One idea to increase the social context of the task is to recreate a prior social interaction between the participant and the agent on screen. In a brief spin-off attempt (\mbox{\url{https://github.com/ccp-eva/gafo-cc/tree/playground}}), I have created a task version in which the participant can guide where the agent looks: The participant can click on any location on the screen and the agent then gazes at exactly this location. While this certainly remains an interaction on screen, it does enhance the second-person perspective and may underline the shared intentionality between the agent and the participant.

Another idea to increase the social aspects of the task would be to design a joint attention version. Here, the agent could alternate their gaze between the balloon and the participant. This might underline the intention of the agent to guide the participant to the balloon location and potentially increase the motivation of the participant to follow the agent's gaze. It might be worthwhile to first investigate how participants behave when the agent only shows saccade eye movement to the target location. Having the agent's gaze only shortly available to the target location might increase the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC)'s difficulty.

The cognitive model of gaze following (see \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}) assumes that participants integrate information of the agent's left and right eye to estimate their attentional focus. Potentially, integrating the information is especially important for the more challenging target locations to the sides. The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) could easily be adapted to test this claim. For example, the agent could be modified into a playful, alien-like appearance which would make it possible to vary the number of eyes (e.g., one vs.~three eyes). This setup could help to disentangle on which pupils the participants rely on to estimate the focus of attention.

Another assumption of the gaze model is that participants show a bias towards the screen center. We could explore which components leads to this center bias by creating new starting scenes in the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC): The position of the agent and the starting point of the balloon could be varied. For example, the agent could be positioned on the very left- or right-hand side of the scene. Furthermore, we could modify the direction of the balloon's trajectory. So far, the balloon's final position varies on the horizontal plane. We could estimate whether difficulties vary when the balloon varies on the vertical plane which has been shown to develop later in gaze following (\citeproc{ref-silverstein2021infants}{Silverstein et al., 2021}).

Most importantly, the current version of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) results in different distances for different target positions: the very far left and right target positions yield the longest balloon trajectories. Together with the characteristics of distributions in the gaze model, this results in the prediction that participants show greater imprecision in trials where the balloon lands sideways. An alternative setup could employ a circle-based design (G. Gredebäck, personal communication, July 14, 2022). Imagine a clock. The agent and balloon starting position would be in its center. This time, however, the balloon would fly in all possible directions like watch hands pointing at the 12 different hours. Importantly, the movement radius of the balloon would stay the same so that it always covers the same distance. This alternative design could circumvent the potential diffusion between participant precision and balloon distance, which would allow us to refine the cognitive gaze model.

Lastly, a touchscreen familiarization could be completed before participants start the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC). This might be especially helpful for participants with no or little technology exposure (see \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}). One idea would be to implement a bubble wrap game in which participants can crush little air pockets (or even balloons) by quickly clicking on them. This design could accustom participants to be precise, determined, motivated and quick in their touchscreen responses. Of course, a touchscreen training like the this would benefit from the existing testing infrastructure of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC).

\subsection{Open Research Questions}\label{outlook-questions}

While we have successfully studied gaze following from early childhood into old age, we have relied on a cross-sectional study design. Future research could employ the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) in a longitudinal study to investigate how children develop and refine their gaze following abilities throughout their childhood. Combining such efforts with the collection of demographic variables and other (social-) cognitive abilities would result in an even more fine-grained understanding of helping and hindering factors in this development.

So far, we have relied on an active behavioral task. Future research could apply eye tracking with the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC). This would have several advantages. First, by moving away from an active behavioral choice, younger infants could be included. This would complete the lifespan perspective from \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} and enable testing the cognitive gaze model for this age group. Second, we could compare touch and gaze behavior. This might be especially interesting for children who are imprecise in their touch behavior. Do these children look exactly where the agent is gazing and are just imprecise in their touch behavior? Or do they rather already look imprecisely and touch exactly at where they themselves have followed the agent's gaze to? The interplay or match between looking and touching behavior might prove helpful in identifying the sources of errors, which --- in turn --- would be very informative for computational modeling work (\citeproc{ref-hoffman2022catching}{Hoffman \& Walters, 2022}).

Our proposed gaze model established a process-level theory of how people estimate another agent's point of attention. What it does not include is a theory on the emergence of gaze following in the first place. It remains unclear which mechanisms drive children to start following eye gaze (\citeproc{ref-astor2022gaze}{Astor \& Gredebäck, 2022}). Existing theories place different emphasis on children's innate abilities (\citeproc{ref-baron-cohen1995mindblindness}{Baron-Cohen, 1995}; \citeproc{ref-batki2000there}{Batki et al., 2000}), their social awareness and motivation (\citeproc{ref-astor2020social}{Astor et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-friesen2011gaze}{Friesen \& Rao, 2011}; \citeproc{ref-ishikawa2020learning}{Ishikawa et al., 2020}; \citeproc{ref-meltzoff2007me}{Meltzoff, 2007}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello1999social}{Tomasello, 1999}), or their propensity for reinforced learning (\citeproc{ref-corkum1998origins}{Corkum \& Moore, 1998}; \citeproc{ref-silverstein2021infants}{Silverstein et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-triesch2006gaze}{Triesch et al., 2006}). Testing these theories against each other and disentangling potential driving forces in the development of gaze following remains an interesting open research avenue.

The \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) focuses on the detection of gaze direction and as such, more on the participant's passive role as a gaze observer and the information-acquiring and -processing perspective. However, eye gaze has been said to fulfill many different functions in social interactions: eye gaze might signal a warning, a communicative intention or an emotional state (e.g., \citeproc{ref-argyle1973different}{Argyle et al., 1973}). Recent research by Gerlofs et al. (\citeproc{ref-gerlofs2022eye}{2022}) has started to look into the communicative component of gaze by studying adults' looking behavior during a hide-and-seek game. Future research could investigate the developmental origins of the different gaze functions and how children decide how to direct their own gaze.

We have seen that, often, developmental theories assume that social interactions shape social-cognitive abilities. For example, infants are particularly responsive to contingencies experienced during daily interactions with their caregivers (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{Akhtar \& Gernsbacher, 2008}; \citeproc{ref-bigelow1998infants}{Bigelow, 1998}; \citeproc{ref-bigelow1999effects}{Bigelow \& Birch, 1999}; \citeproc{ref-bigelow2006two}{Bigelow \& Rochat, 2006}). In \hyperref[studyI]{Study I}, we found suggestive evidence that opportunities to interact socially correspond to higher precision levels in gaze following. However, this claim needs further empirical justification. Most importantly, we need good measures on both ends: for the social-cognitive abilities in question but also for children's daily social interactions. The parental questionnaire applied in \hyperref[studyI]{Study I} could only serve as a rough proxy for children's daily interactions. What is needed are more fine-grained tools to capture children's lived experiences. Modern machine learning and computer vision advancements seem to be a promising avenue in this regard (\citeproc{ref-bergelson2023everyday}{Bergelson et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-donnelly2021longitudinal}{Donnelly \& Kidd, 2021}; \citeproc{ref-duan2017computer}{Duan et al., 2017}; \citeproc{ref-isaev2024computer}{Isaev et al., 2024}; \citeproc{ref-long2023babyview}{Long et al., 2023}; \citeproc{ref-malmir2013home}{Malmir et al., 2013}; \citeproc{ref-mcmahon2023seeing}{McMahon \& Isik, 2023}). Furthermore, we could not replicate the relationship between gaze following and the number of siblings in the cross-cultural sample (see \hyperref[studyIII]{Study III}). Cross-culturally assessing these family-level variables in more detail could help to settle this research question.

The relationships between gaze following precision and language abilities, non-social vector following, and perspective taking were only assessed in a sample from the Global North (Leipzig, Germany). Future research could investigate said relationships in more diverse communities to test whether they are generalizable.

The studies included in this dissertation focus on gaze following as an important cornerstone for a child's social-cognitive development. While face-to-face interactions and eye contact are highlighted in Western culture, other communities might focus more on other social and communicative cues. Akhtar \& Gernsbacher (\citeproc{ref-akhtar2008privileging}{2008}) have cautioned to exclusively rely on gaze following as a measure of social engagement and attention/intention understanding. Future studies should examine how other senses like tactile and or verbal modalities (e.g., touch, prosody, voice direction) are used across diverse communities to determine the attentional focus of another agent Wefers et al. (\citeproc{ref-wefers2023universality}{2023}). A positive example of such work comes from Bard et al. (\citeproc{ref-bard2021joint}{2021}) who have proposed a culturally inclusive concept of \emph{joint engagement} which allows for these expressions in other modalities and with more diverse social partners and topics. Indeed, traditional visual joint attention episodes were more common in Western communities, while ``triadic connectedness'' was observed in infants coming from a community in the U.K., from a Nso community in Cameroon, and an Aka community in the Central African Republic (\citeproc{ref-bard2021joint}{Bard et al., 2021}).

To come back to the \hyperref[introduction]{Introduction}, we could further assess the claim that social-cognitive abilities define what makes us uniquely human. Existing research has shown that great apes and other mammals can follow gaze (\citeproc{ref-itakura2004gazefollowing}{Itakura, 2004}; \citeproc{ref-kano2014crossspecies}{Kano \& Call, 2014}; \citeproc{ref-rosati2009looking}{Rosati \& Hare, 2009}; \citeproc{ref-tomasello1998five}{Tomasello et al., 1998}). However, Tomasello et al. (\citeproc{ref-tomasello2007reliance}{2007}) found that great apes mainly followed ``gaze'' based on the head movement of the other agent. To further test whether eye gaze alone is an insufficient cue for great apes, the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) could be adjusted for comparative use: how would non-human great apes perform in this gaze following task? Studies could either rely on tracking the eye gaze of the apes (e.g., \citeproc{ref-krupenye2016great}{Krupenye et al., 2016}) or stick with the touchscreen format. Many of the chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center in Leipzig, Germany, have gained experience with participating in touchscreen studies (\citeproc{ref-allritz2021chimpanzees}{Allritz et al., 2021}; \citeproc{ref-close2015colour}{Close \& Call, 2015}; \citeproc{ref-margiotoudi2019sound}{Margiotoudi et al., 2019}; \citeproc{ref-munar2015common}{Munar et al., 2015}), and the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) might be feasible for this testing setup.

While the studies included in this dissertation focus on social cognition and gaze following, we also invented a new continuous task of non-social vector following (see \hyperref[studyII]{Study II}). Having this task at hand, we could examine whether vector estimation is needed for other social-cognitive abilities. For example, predicting an action of another agent (e.g., pointing or reaching for a cup) might rely on estimating vectors in space (\citeproc{ref-omadagain2019origin}{O'Madagain et al., 2019}). Studying how social- and non-social cognitive abilities interact with each other will help us to disentangle the (inter) independence of our core cognitive processes.

Future studies could investigate individual differences in other, potentially more complex social-cognitive abilities. As we have seen in the \hyperref[introduction]{Introduction}, experts have assumed little variation in children's gaze following. The studies included in this dissertation have shown that children do vary even in this fundamental social-cognitive ability --- although the variation clearly does not mainly arise in \emph{if} children follow gaze but \emph{how precisely} they do so. It remains an interesting open research avenue to assess how children vary in more complex social-cognitive abilities. One example of such an ability could be how children learn to distinguish different knowledge states. A classical test of understanding knowledge access comes from Wellman et al. (\citeproc{ref-wellman2001metaanalysis}{2001}): here, children see the content of a box and need to judge whether another ignorant agent knows what is inside this box. Similar to the Sally-Anne \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} task, the outcome variable is dichotomous and does not leave much room for measuring children's increasingly fine-grained social cognition. In a preliminary pilot study, we have begun to implement a continuous outcome measure that captures children's sensitivity to gradual knowledge states (\hyperref[acronyms_DISKO]{Differentiating Incomplete States of Knowledge --- Open (DISKO)}; \mbox{\url{https://github.com/ccp-eva/disko}}). Children witness how an agent walks with her pet into a hut. They walk along one out of several paths that are built like a decision tree. Familiarization trials show children that the agent and the pet always want to reach the same hut. In the test trials, the agent witnesses differing amounts of the pathway that her pet is walking. For example, the agent sees her pet taking the very first turn to the left, but then a telephone rings and the agent has to leave. The pet continues to walk the pathway into one of the huts. The agent returns and children are asked to predict to which hut the agent will go. They can distribute sticker across all options. For children that show knowledge---ignorance understanding, they should vary their sticker distribution so that it matches the epistemic state of the agent (\emph{i.e.,} placing no sticker on huts that the agent can exclude as the pet's location; and equally placing sticker on the huts where her pet could be). As such, the \hyperref[acronyms_DISKO]{DISKO} could measure children's action prediction in situations where the agent has gradually varying knowledge access.

Computational cognitive modeling might prove helpful in describing and predicting this social-cognitive ability. A potential model could involve two model parameters: \(\beta_1\) and \(\beta_2\). The parameter \(\beta_1\) would capture children's sensitivity to differences in knowledge states based on differential perceptual input, and the parameter \(\beta_2\) would capture how much children get biased or distorted by reality (\emph{i.e.}, action prediction based on the agent's belief or the world state as in the pet's actual location). The gaze model proposed in \hyperref[studyII]{Study II} could potentially serve as one of the components that make up \(\beta_1\). The parameter \(\beta_2\) could potentially be useful for modeling \hyperref[acronyms_FB]{FB} understanding. This proposed study idea highlights (at least) two new research aims. First, it highlights how new study designs could measure social cognition in a more continuous, fine-grained manner so that individual differences can be captured --- eventually building up a new social cognition task battery. Second, it underlines the appeal of modeling social cognition. Cognitive models could build up on each other and break down which components are needed to master a certain ability (\citeproc{ref-baker2017rational}{Baker et al., 2017}). Potentially, we could assess whether gaze following is, indeed, a fundament for other social-cognitive abilities.

\newpage

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this dissertation, I have questioned the traditional perspective of interpreting individual differences as measurement error or noise, and have shed new light on existing variation in social cognition. I have shown the added value of this perspective on the concrete example of gaze following across individuals, ages, and communities. The studies included in this dissertation have reported the development, psychometric assessment, and application of a new task to measure individual differences in gaze following. The extensive evaluation of the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO} and the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGOux2014CC]{TANGO---CC}, respectively, constitutes an exception in the field of social-cognitive studies. Administering the \hyperref[acronyms_TANGO]{TANGO}(---CC) has enabled us to gain a comprehensive, multi-perspective view on gaze following and decipher the universal cognitive processes behind it. A computational cognitive model showed that children and adults follow gaze by estimating pupil angles and, consequently, gaze vectors that run from the center of the eye through the pupil. The development of gaze following, and behavioral differences, can be explained by varying amounts of uncertainty in this noisy inference process. The proposed gaze model could describe children's gaze following in 17 diverse communities worldwide, which speaks for a universal cognitive process in estimating gaze directions. Furthermore, gaze following related to children's receptive vocabulary, proxies of social interaction opportunities, non-social vector following and perspective-taking abilities (in a German child sample). In sum, this dissertation illustrates how combining reliable tasks, formal theoretical models, and cross-cultural research enables us to study the development and mechanisms of social cognition --- precisely those abilities that make us uniquely human.

\textbf{Abstract:} Do toddlers and adults engage in spontaneous Theory of Mind (ToM)? Evidence from anticipatory looking (AL) studies suggests that they do. But a growing body of failed replication studies raised questions about the paradigm's suitability. In this multi-lab collaboration, we test the robustness of spontaneous ToM measures. We examine whether 18- to 27-month-olds' and adults' anticipatory looks distinguish between two basic forms of an agent's epistemic states: knowledge and ignorance. In toddlers {[}ANTICIPATED n = 520 50\% FEMALE{]} and adults {[}ANTICIPATED n = 408, 50\% FEMALE{]} from diverse ethnic backgrounds, we found {[}SUPPORT/NO SUPPORT{]} for epistemic state-based action anticipation. Future research can probe whether this conclusion extends to more complex kinds of epistemic states, such as true and false beliefs.

\section*{PREVIC: An adaptive parent report measure of expressive vocabulary in children between 3 and 8 years of age}\label{previc}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{PREVIC: An adaptive parent report measure of expressive vocabulary in children between 3 and 8 years of age}

\textbf{Citation:} Bohn, M., Prein, J. C., Engicht, J., Haun, D., Gagarina, N., \& Koch, T. (2023). \emph{PREVIC: An adaptive parent report measure of expressive vocabulary in children between 3 and 8 years of age.} {[}Manuscript submitted for publication{]}. PsyArXiv. \mbox{\url{https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hvncp}}

\textbf{Abstract:} Parent report measures have proven to be a valuable research tool to study early language development. Caregivers are given a list of words and are asked which of them their child has already used. However, most available measures are not suited for children beyond infancy, come with substantial licensing costs or lack a clear psychometric foundation. Here we present the PREVIC (Parent Report of Expressive Vocabulary in Children), an open access, high quality vocabulary checklist for German-speaking children between three and eight years of age. The PREVIC was constructed leveraging the advantages of Item Response Theory: we designed a large initial item pool of 379 words and collected data from N = 1190 caregivers of children between three and eight years of age. Based on this data, we computed a range of fit indices for each item (word) and used an automated item selection algorithm to compile a final pool that contains items that a) vary in difficulty and b) fit the Rasch (one-parameter logistic) model. The resulting task is highly reliable and shows convergent validity. The IRT-based construction allowed us to design an adaptive version of the task, which substantially reduces the duration of the task while retaining measurement precision. The task -- including the adaptive version -- was implemented as a website and is freely accessible online (\mbox{\url{https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/previc-demo/}}). The PREVIC fills an important gap in the toolkit of researchers interested in language development and provides an ideal starting point for the development of converging measures in other languages.

\textbf{Citation:} Bohn, M.*, Prein, J.*, Koch, T., Bee, R. M., Delikaya, B., Haun, D., \& Gagarina, N. (2024). oREV: An item response theory-based open receptive vocabulary task for 3- to 8-year-old children. \emph{Behavior Research Methods, 56}(3), 2595--2605. \mbox{\url{https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02169-3}}

\textbf{Abstract:} Individual differences in early language abilities are an important predictor of later life outcomes. High-quality, easy-access measures of language abilities are rare, especially in the preschool and primary school years. The present study describes the construction of a new receptive vocabulary task for children between 3 and 8 years of age. The task was implemented as a browser-based web application, allowing for both in-person and remote data collection via the internet. Based on data from N = 581 German-speaking children, we estimated the psychometric properties of each item in a larger initial item pool via item response modeling. We then applied an automated item selection procedure to select an optimal subset of items based on item difficulty and discrimination. The so-constructed task has 22 items and shows excellent psychometric properties with respect to reliability, stability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The construction, implementation, and item selection process described here makes it easy to extend the task or adapt it to different languages. All materials and code are freely accessible to interested researchers. The task can be used via the following website: \mbox{\url{https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/orev-demo}}.

\section*{Validation of an open source, remote web-based eye-tracking method (WebGazer) for research in early childhood}\label{manywebcams}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Validation of an open source, remote web-based eye-tracking method (WebGazer) for research in early childhood}

\textbf{Citation:} Steffan, A., Zimmer, L., Arias-Trejo, N., Bohn, M., Dal Ben, R., Flores-Coronado, M. A., Franchin, L., Garbisch, I., Grosse Wiesmann, C., Hamlin, J. K., Havron, N., Hay, J. F., Hermansen, T. K., Jakobsen, K. V., Kalinke, S., Ko, E.-S., Kulke, L., Mayor, J., Meristo, M., \ldots, Prein, J., \ldots, Schuwerk, T. (2024). Validation of an open source, remote web-based eye-tracking method (WebGazer) for research in early childhood. \emph{Infancy, 29}(1), 31--55. \mbox{\url{https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12564}}

\textbf{Abstract:} Measuring eye movements remotely via the participant's webcam promises to be an attractive methodological addition to in-person eye-tracking in the lab. However, there is a lack of systematic research comparing remote web-based eye-tracking with in-lab eye-tracking in young children. We report a multi-lab study that compared these two measures in an anticipatory looking task with toddlers using WebGazer.js and jsPsych. Results of our remotely tested sample of 18-27-month-old toddlers (N = 125) revealed that web-based eye-tracking successfully captured goal-based action predictions, although the proportion of the goal-directed anticipatory looking was lower compared to the in-lab sample (N = 70). As expected, attrition rate was substantially higher in the web-based (42\%) than the in-lab sample (10\%). Excluding trials based on visual inspection of the match of time-locked gaze coordinates and the participant's webcam video overlayed on the stimuli was an important preprocessing step to reduce noise in the data. We discuss the use of this remote web-based method in comparison with other current methodological innovations. Our study demonstrates that remote web-based eye-tracking can be a useful tool for testing toddlers, facilitating recruitment of larger and more diverse samples; a caveat to consider is the larger drop-out rate.
