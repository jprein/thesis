## Research Contributions

-   also include orev & previc as examples how the platform idea is useful tool (gleiche Plattform, Prinzipien der Entwicklung)

## Limitations

### The task itself

-   social enough? still on screen, only observing
-   idea for first social interaction, where participant guides where agent looks. more like a second-person perspective
-   change in framing: gaze understanding to gaze following. why?

Developmental studies often report high number of drop-out rates, for example because of children's fuzziness (todo: example). Administering the The TANGO(â€”CC) has proven very helpful in this regard: across communities, children tended to complete the task with ease and even asked for a repetition. Drop-out rates could thus be greatly reduced. As the data collection procedures varied slightly from community to community, we cannot report exact numbers of drop-outs but rely on the experience of experimenters.

### Modeling

-   why is gafo still social if vector?
-   why model needed? cc signature pattern, other interpretation than raw scores, in future incorporate more complex mental states
-   why new? compared to others, only reliance on eyes not head. plus ind diff

### Cross-cultural work

-   do not want to signal cc is easy or we propose parachute science
-   technology effect: yes but still ind diff in communities where touchscreen = 1
-   more helpful to check relative imprecision, not absolute values within or between communities
-   idea for touchscreen familiarization: bubble wrap game
-   [@wellman2013universal] how can social cognition be universal and yet vary? framework understanding 
-   importantly, focusing on signature patterns helps us to study underlying cognitive processes, which raw absolutes score could not have revealed 
-   don't just compare urban global north to rural global south, which is common pitfall in CC work (Barrett 2020)

## Outlook

Applying the tool: Chapter on how Gafo can be extended to answer new research questions.

### Variations of TANGO

-   gafo alien to answer why we need to integrate information from 2 eyes. probably important for side locations in tango?
-   circle like clock to circumvent precision with distance diffusion
-   different starting directions to avoid center bias

### Open research questions

-   but also: all methods sanity checks so that now theory testing can start
-   do social interactions shape social cognition abilities? we need good measures on both ends, machine learning as promising avenue
-   back to uniquely human: what about great apes? how would they perform in gafo?
-   now that we can study vector following, we can also go down this path: is vector estimation needed in other social cognitive abilities? what about for example action prediction, reaching at sth?

## Conclusion
