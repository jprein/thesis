# Authorship Note {-#authorship}

In this dissertation, the plural pronoun "we" highlights the collaborative efforts within the presented scientific projects. The contributions of all co-authors of the included manuscripts are transparently and accurately attributed using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT; \mbox{\url{https://credit.niso.org}}) and can be found for each respective manuscript in [Appendix A](#appendixA). In situations where the primary responsible person is not explicitly defined, "we" refers to the efforts of this dissertation's author alone, as the plural pronoun "we" reflects standard practice in psychological scientific writings. This use does not diminish the author's significance in conceptualizing, executing, documenting, and interpreting the presented research. The singular pronoun "I" explicitly denotes personal opinions, reflections, and decisions regarding this dissertation's theoretical framework paper and its structure.
