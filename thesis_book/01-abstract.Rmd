Social cognition enables children to engage effectively with peers, teachers, and family, making them active members of society. Throughout childhood, individuals learn to collaborate efficiently, predict future actions, and reason about the desires, beliefs, and percepts of themselves and others. The bedrock of many social-cognitive abilities is gaze following: Identifying another's attentional focus is valuable for extracting information from the environment and determining the internal states of other agents. The emergence of gaze following has been thoroughly studied on a group level in children from the Global North. Yet, we know little about individual-level and cross-cultural variation. This is problematic because many developmental theories emphasize the role of social interaction in the development of social cognition\thinspace --\thinspace and the frequency and characteristics of social interactions vary substantially across individuals and cultures. This dissertation aims to highlight the prevalence and importance of variation in social cognition based on the example of gaze following. In four studies, we have designed, implemented, and applied a new gaze following task to capture individual- and community-level variation. 

Study I focused on the development and psychometric assessment of the new task, the TANGO. An animated interactive picture book asked participants to locate a balloon with the help of a gaze cue. A spatial layout allowed for a discrete and continuous measure of participants’ imprecision in locating the attentional focus. We implemented a new interactive web application that works across devices and enables supervised and unsupervised in-person and remote testing. We found substantial individual differences in a child (*N*\thinspace=\thinspace 387 from Leipzig, Germany) and an adult (*N*\thinspace =\thinspace 236, international remote) sample. Psychometric properties, in the form of high internal consistency and test-retest reliability, indicated highly systematic variation. Relationships with family-level variables and children's language abilities underline the validity of the task. Together, the results show how the TANGO is a reliable and valid tool to assess individual differences in gaze following.

Study II applied the TANGO to three research questions focusing on individual differences in gaze following. First, we examined gaze following across the lifespan (*N*\thinspace =\thinspace 478 3- to 19-year-olds from Leipzig, Germany, and *N*\thinspace =\thinspace 240 20- to 80-year-old international, remotely tested adults). During preschool years, children became increasingly precise in gaze following. Young adults reached the highest precision levels, which slightly declined toward old age. Across all age groups, participants showed individual differences. Second, we conceptualized individual differences in gaze following in a computational cognitive model (*N*\thinspace =\thinspace 60 3- to 5-year-olds and *N*\thinspace =\thinspace 50 adults). Participants were modeled to observe the agent's pupil location within the eye and estimate the resulting pupil angles and gaze vectors. This inferential estimation process was assumed to be noisy. Individual differences and the development of gaze following were described as varying levels in the precision to estimate pupil angles. A model comparison with two alternative models and a signature pattern in the data yielded strong evidence for the proposed gaze model. Third, we experimentally tested the model's assumption describing gaze following as a form of social vector estimation (*N*\thinspace =\thinspace 102 4- to 5-year-olds). Individuals' gaze-following abilities correlated with their precision in non-social vector estimation and visual perspective-taking. Other Theory of Mind tasks did not correlate. These findings suggest that gaze following relies on attention to social as well as spatial components.

Study III presented the largest cross-cultural study on children's gaze following abilities to this date (*N*\thinspace =\thinspace 1377): We studied 2.5- to 11-year-olds from 17 different urban/rural communities in Argentina, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Germany, India, Mexico, Namibia, Nigeria, New Zealand, Sambia, Türkiye, the UK, Uganda, and the USA. Across communities, we found similar substantial developmental gains: With increasing age, children got more precise in locating the attentional focus of another agent. Absolute differences in imprecision levels could be partially explained by children's familiarity with the data collection device (tablet/touchscreen). In all communities, we found the same signature pattern in the data, and comparisons to alternative models provided strong evidence for the previously proposed gaze model. Despite existing individual- and community-level variation in observable behavior, this speaks for a universal mechanism in how children follow gaze.

Study IV describes the design process of the TANGO-CC, the cross-cultural gaze following task we used in Study III. We provided an open-source website and tutorial for researchers to adapt the TANGO-CC to their needs (e.g., selecting language and stimuli). Re-analyzing the data set of Study III, we found individual differences across communities and within-community variation outweighed between-community variation. Most importantly, we found satisfactory split-half reliability estimates for each community. These findings indicated the TANGO-CC's suitability for cross-cultural research. 

Taken together, this dissertation takes an innovative, extensive, multifaceted perspective on gaze following and the cognitive processes behind it. It highlights how combining individual differences, cross-cultural research, and formal modeling will enable us to explore the development and structure of our core social-cognitive processes in greater detail.
