## Summary of Results

### Results of Study I {#resultsI}

In [Study I](#studyI), we have examined the \acr{TANGO} as a viable tool for studying individual differences in gaze following.

First, the practicability of the task and its capacity to capture individual differences was assessed. We found the \acr{TANGO} to be engaging for young children and adults alike. Participants could complete 15 test trials within five to ten minutes. The presentation as a web-app functioned smoothly across different browsers and devices, and data was reliably uploaded to the servers. Children showed similar developmental trajectories in both versions of the task (*i.e.*, discrete box version, continuous hedge version). While the average three-year-old were still rather imprecise in locating the target (only slightly better than chance in the box version), children became more precise with increasing age. In neither of the versions did the children or adults reach ceiling levels in their performance. We found individual differences across all ages. For example, some of the five-year-old children were more imprecise in their gaze following abilities than the average three-year-old. Data collected remotely without supervision closely resembled those that were collected in person.

Second, excellent psychometric properties underscored that the individual differences in gaze following were meaningful and could not be ascribed to random noise. High retest reliability estimates proved that the \acr{TANGO} did not simply capture daily fluctuations but stable ability levels across time. By using a \acr{GLMM}-based modeling approach [@rouder2019psychometrics], we could provide an age correction for the retest-reliability estimates. The resulting age-independent \acr{GLMM}-based estimates were higher than the previously estimated *Pearson* correlations. Internal consistency estimates also pointed to the reliability of the \acr{TANGO} and suggested that participants' performance within one session was not affected by trivial effects like exhaustion or habituation. We found that different splitting and stratification methods previously proposed by @pronk2022methods let to similar or even higher internal consistency estimates.

Third, we evaluated the \acr{TANGO}'s validity by probing correlations between gaze following and concepts considered to be theoretically associated: social interactions and language abilities. Via a short parental questionnaire, we coarsely estimated children's opportunities for daily social interactions (e.g., asking for the number and age of siblings, average time spent in daycare and age at daycare entry). We found that children who entered daycare in a young age were less likely to be imprecise in gaze following. Although the other social interaction proxies did not improve the model fit, the results pointed into the expected direction: the more opportunities for social interactions a child had, the more precise they were in gaze following. Additionally, we administered the \acr{oREV} to assess children's language abilities six months after they completed the \acr{TANGO}. The \acr{TANGO} could be used to predict children's receptive vocabulary, even when correcting for age.

Taken together, [Study I](#studyI) established the \acr{TANGO} as a reliable and valid individual differences measure of gaze following.

### Results of Study II {#resultsII}

[Study II](#studyII) showed an exemplary way how the \acr{TANGO} (in its continuous version) can be used to answer research questions on individual differences in gaze following.

First, we found that precision in gaze following develops throughout the lifespan. Childhood was characterized by rapid changes in which children' imprecision levels in gaze following were more than halved. During early adulthood, participants were most precise and stable in their gaze following abilities. Toward older age, precision levels slightly decreased again. We found individual differences in all age groups.

Second, we designed a cognitive model to interpret individual differences in gaze following in a psychologically meaningful way. The proposed process model aimed to depict how participants infer the agent's attentional focus in the \acr{TANGO}. It assumed that participants estimate the centers of the agent's eyeball and pupil and connect those as a gaze vector (*i.e.*, line-of-sight). The pupil angle, respectively, is the angle between this gaze vector and a vector pointing horizontally to the ground. Participants were assumed to integrate the information of the pupil angles (and gaze vectors) from the left and right eye. The point at which both gaze vectors meet defined the attentional focus of the agent. Estimating the pupil angles was assumed to be a noisy process. This was modeled as participants sampling estimated pupil angles from a probability distribution which was shaped by multiplying two Normal distributions centered on the true pupil angles with equal variance. Individual differences were modeled by differing degrees of uncertainty around the pupil angle (*i.e.*, the variance representing the width of the distribution). The development (or refinement) of gaze following was conceptualized as a decrease in uncertainty around the pupil angles which should result in less imprecision in the \acr{TANGO}. The characteristics of the probability distribution described above resulted in the following prediction: When the agent gazed towards the side, the distribution from which the participants sampled was wider compared to when the agent gazed centrally to the ground (see Figure 2 in [Study II](#studyII)). Therefore, participants should be more imprecise for target locations further out.

The results provided substantial evidence for the proposed gaze model. In the child as well as the adult sample, the gaze model estimates correlated strongly with the data mean. Participants' imprecision levels across target bins resembled a U-shape, which matched the prediction of the gaze model: targets on the very left- or right-hand side led to the highest imprecision levels, while center targets led to a decrease in imprecision. Compared to two alternative models that explained the data by a center bias or random guessing, the gaze model was clearly favored.

As became evident, the gaze model described gaze following as a social form of vector following. We tested this proposed relationship experimentally and found that gaze following correlated moderately with a non-social vector following task. Additionally, gaze following was related to two perspective-taking tasks [@flavell1981younga; @flavell1981development] but not with other \acr{ToM} tasks [@wellman2001metaanalysis]. This suggests that gaze following comprises estimations of vectors in space as well as evaluating another person's point of view.

In sum, [Study II](#studyII) illustrated the continuing development of accurately interpreting another's gaze direction, along with the cognitive processes behind this ability.

### Results of Study III {#resultsIII}

Developmental theories often (implicitly) assume that social-cognitive abilities develop and function in the same way across human cultures. In [Study III](#studyIII), we experimentally tested this claim. While [Study I](#studyI) and [Study II](#studyII) relied on child samples from one specific community in the Global North (Leipzig, Germany), [Study III](#studyIII) assessed gaze following in children around the world.

First, we found that children across the 17 studied communities got substantially more precise in gaze following with increasing age. A model that assumed cross-cultural variation in average performance and in the developmental trajectories performed better than simpler models. Nevertheless, individuals did not cluster by community which was shown by largely overlapping distributions. Individual differences were found between all age groups and communities.

Second, we tested whether the gaze model proposed in [Study II](#studyII) would be applicable to every studied community. Matching the model prediction, children across all communities were more precise in locating the attentional focus of the agent when they gazed centrally compared to sideways. A model comparison with the center bias and random guessing models revealed overwhelming support for the gaze model.

Third, absolute differences in gaze following precision could be partially explained by the data collection method. Children with no access to touchscreens were found to be less precise in the \acr{TANGO}. Yet, individual differences were still present in communities where 100% of children had access to touchscreens. Similar to [Study I](#studyI), we predicted that children with relatively more opportunities for social interaction within one community would show higher levels of gaze following precision. We did not find any evidence for a relationship between gaze following and the collected demographic variables (e.g., size of household, number of children).

Overall, the findings of [Study III](#studyIII) suggested that children from diverse communities were remarkably consistent in the way they processed gaze, while individual differences were found everywhere.

### Results of Study IV {#resultsIV}

As [Study III](#studyIII) relied on participants from diverse communities, we further developed the continuous version of the \acr{TANGO} into the \acr{TANGO—CC}, which exchanged the animal stimuli of the \acr{TANGO} for human stimuli and included 13 new instruction languages. Importantly, the \acr{TANGO—CC} addressed the often declared need for new tasks to assess social cognition across diverse communities. [Study IV](#studyIV) described the design process of the \acr{TANGO—CC} and examined the psychometric grounds for its use in cross-cultural data collection. For this purpose, we re-used the data set of [Study III](#studyIII).

First, we described our pragmatic approach to task development. While we thoroughly assessed the psychometrics of basic version of the \acr{TANGO} in a German setting (see [Study I](#studyI)), we already worked on the cross-cultural stimulus development and selection. The input of and collaboration with local researchers and assistants was invaluable in creating the new stimulus set. The \acr{TANGO—CC}'s web-app implementation proved highly useful in adapting the stimuli and enabling a swift data collection. Children from all over the world felt comfortable participating in the tablet study, irregardless of whether they had previous touchscreen experience or not, and the extensive data set of [Study III](#studyIII) proved the feasibility of the \acr{TANGO—CC} for cross-cultural data collection.

Second, the manuscript visualized the customizable components of the \acr{TANGO—CC}. We featured a tutorial for how other researchers interested in using the \acr{TANGO—CC} can adjust the task to their needs.

Third, and most prominently, we assessed whether the \acr{TANGO—CC}'s reliability was generalizable to other communities. Children across communities performed best in training trials compared to test trials. Variation within communities (*i.e.*, individual differences) greatly outweighed variation between communities. (Split-half) Reliability was assessed by three different approaches to calculate internal consistency: a simple odd-even split, a stratification by target centrality, and a model-based age correction in addition to the stratification. All three approaches yielded similar results, speaking for a high internal consistency across different communities.

Altogether, these findings underline the \acr{TANGO—CC}'s suitability to study the development of gaze following across individuals and communities.

## Research Contributions

The projects included in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of child development from two different perspectives: (1) by extending our knowledge about meaningful variation in social cognition, and (2) by providing modern, valid, reliable, and generalizable open-access tools to other researchers. I will begin by considering the first aspect before moving on to the second aspect.

### Theoretical Contributions {#theoreticalcontributions}

Our newly developed gaze following task(s) (the \acr{TANGO} and \acr{TANGO—CC}, respectively) have enabled us to study variation in one of the most fundamental social-cognitive abilities in greater detail. We have focused on (1) the lifelong development of gaze following, (2) a mechanistic explanation of the cognitive processes behind it, (3) the relationship to other (social-) cognitive abilities, and (4) the universality of gaze following.

A large body of research has investigated the emergence of gaze following in infancy (for review, see @delbianco2019developmental). Yet, little was known about the further development once certain qualitative milestones (e.g., following gaze behind barriers or to locations behind themselves, [@butterworth1991minds; @corkum1995development; @deak2000effects; @moll200412]) are reached. We could show that the precision to locate another's attentional focus does indeed increase until adolescence. By conducting [Study II](#studyII) across the lifespan, we could identify the shape of change in gaze following: in early years, children refine their precision in gaze following until they reach an adult-like level performance. In later years, performance slightly decreases again. This underlines that gaze following — like probably many other (social-) cognitive abilities [e.g., @raviv2018developmental] — continues to develop after its initial emergence in infancy. While the earliest instance of a social-cognitive ability might be informative for the pre-requisites of this ability, studying its further development illuminates

We have proposed a tool for interpreting individual differences in gaze following, specifically in the form of a computational cognitive model. While existing theories have visualized gaze following as tracing a line of sight [@anstis1969perception; @symons2004you; @todorovic2006geometrical; @yaniv1990heuristics], we have formulated this idea as a testable, well-defined mathematical model with explicit assumptions. Most importantly, we have included a conceptualization of individual differences. Our model assumes that individuals differ in their uncertainty around estimated pupil angles. This formulation also helps us to conceive development, namely as a reduction in the uncertainty around the pupil angles. The gaze model makes interesting group-level predictions. We could confirm that the distance between the agent and their focus of attention (or, in other words, the centrality) does indeed influence people's precision in gaze following. A carefully designed, matched non-social vector following task correlated with gaze following, which highlights the importance of vector estimation in gaze following.

Furthermore, the proposed gaze model has demonstrated its relevance in cross-cultural research. We found slight differences across communities in the absolute precision in children's gaze following. Had we simply compared those absolute values, we might have interpreted the findings in a way that eye gaze is processed differently across communities. Already @innis1989should have pointed out that "different performance patterns cannot be taken as evidence for different underlying mechanisms. And, symmetrically, similar performance cannot be taken as evidence for similar mechanisms" (p. 155). Consequently, they have argued for describing the formal mechanisms that regulate behavior — instead of focusing on absolute performance levels. By applying the gaze model and checking for its predicted signature patterns in the data, we could move away from the surface-level comparison and indeed found evidence that children worldwide process gaze in similar ways while differing in their certainty around the true pupil angles. Indeed, the gaze model might provide a framework understanding of how social cognition might be universal and yet vary — a leading example to explain how "All people everywhere are different, *and* all people everywhere are the same" [@wellman2013universal, p. 69].

Developmental theories often highlight the importance of social interactions in children's social-cognitive development [e.g., @vygotsky1962thought; @vygotsky1978mind; @vygotsky1987thinking]. Opportunities to observe, play, fight, and communicate with others should highlight their unique mental states which, in turn, facilitates the development of \acr{ToM} and social cognition [@perner1994theory; @peterson2000kindred; @zhang2021worse]. [Study I](#studyI) and [Study II](#studyII) contribute to this body of research. In a German sample, weak positive relationships between gaze following and demographic predictors like age of childcare entry pointed into the same direction.

Related to this is the question of if and how gaze following and perspective-taking are connected [@astor2022gaze]. We could show that children's perspective-taking abilities predicted their imprecision levels in gaze following. Interestingly, other \acr{ToM} tasks did not relate to gaze following. We proposed that the cognitive processes underlying gaze following and perspective-taking overlap as both abilities require taking into account another person's point of view. While other \acr{ToM} tasks often rely on this component as well, they might entail more complex meta-representational aspects, for example, understanding that mental states can be false or aspectual in nature [@rakoczy2022foundations].

A wide-spread notion is that gaze following supports language acquisition: children could follow gaze to identify the referent of a new word [@bohn2022predicting; @delbianco2019developmental; @tomasello2003constructing]. For example, @brooks2005development found that infant's gaze following abilities predicted their language comprehension half a year later. Nevertheless, @astor2022gaze have argued that the relationship between language and gaze following remains inconclusive as a substantial amount of studies reported mixed evidence (see Figure 3 in @astor2022gaze), lack statistical power or combine gaze and point following into composite measures. We addressed these issues by specifically focusing on isolated gaze following and leveraging a large data set. Indeed, imprecision in preschool children's gaze following proved to be a substantial predictor for their receptive vocabulary six months later. This result helps to conclusively settle the research question on the relationship between gaze following and language development.

Taken together, the included studies underline the added value of assessing variation in social cognition and show examplary ways which research questions benefit from an individual differences measure. To go even further, measuring an individual's social-cognitive ability might be even more relevant in clinical or education settings in which practitioners might want to assess and support a child's unique development.

### Methodological Contributions

After having considered how the presented studies have deepened our theoretical knowledge of variation in social cognition, or, more specifically, gaze following, let us now turn to the methodological contributions of this work.

@beaudoin2020systematic have argued that finding appropriate social-cognitive tasks for children remains difficult as few measures continuously measure the ability in question and/or report empirically validated psychometric information. The \acr{TANGO} exists in a categorical and continuous version which increases the flexibility for other interested researchers. In comparison to traditional gaze following tasks [e.g., @astor2020social; @byers-heinlein2021development; @gredeback2010development; @ishikawa2022physiological], the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) isolates eye movement alone and removes potential confounds with simulateous head movements. We have provided a detailed psychometric analysis of the \acr{TANGO} by assessing its validity, internal consistency, and retest reliability. Importantly, internal consistency of the \acr{TANGO—CC} has been also examined for 17 diverse communities.

We have openly shared the stimulus pool and the source code of the \acr{TANGO}(—CC). First, we hope this inspires other researchers to re-use the materials in their own projects. Especially the collection of cartoon-like human faces might prove helpful in designing new social cognition measures that can be adapted for cross-cultural data collection. An exploratory analysis (see [Study II](#studyII)) indicated that superficial stimulus modifications, such as using animal faces versus cartoon human faces, do not affect children's task performance. Second, we count on other researchers to follow this example and share their own materials according to Open Science principles. Providing psychometric information of a newly designed task and making it openly accessible will hopefully help to circumvent the "toothbrush problem" [@elson2023psychological] — namely that researchers are reluctant to re-use measures of other scientists.

The \acr{TANGO}'s code base could be recycled by other researchers to adapt the testing infrastructure for future tasks. It proved to be a very useful tool for collecting data at scale. The COVID-19 pandemic underlined the importance of flexible data collection strategies. The finding that in-person and remote data collection with the \acr{TANGO} yielded similar results (see [Study I](#studyI)) justifies the advance of these new online methods on the foundation of first empirical evidence.

Two additional tasks that emerged as side projects in the context of this dissertation (see [Appendix B](#appendixB)) were designed under the same development principles and operated on very similar data collection platforms: the \acr{oREV}, and the \acr{PREVIC}. The \acr{oREV} is a child-directed measure. The task presents participants with four pictures, that is, one target and three distractors (phonological, semantic, and unrelated). A verbal prompt then asks participants to select the target. The initially larger item pool of the \acr{oREV} included all 30 items of the \acr{CLT} [@haman2015designinga] and added 20 additional items to increase the task's difficulty and avoid ceiling effects for older children. By using \acr{IRT}-modeling based on item difficulty and discrimination, the final item pool of the \acr{oREV} could be decreased to 22 items. With regard to reliability, stability, convergent and discriminant validity, the final task exhibits exceptional psychometric qualities in a German sample. To complement the picture of children's language development, the \acr{PREVIC} serves as a parent-directed measure. The task presents caregivers with a list of words and asked them which of these words their child has already spoken. Similarly to the \acr{oREV}, the \acr{PREVIC} initially consisted of a large item pool of 379 words. By leveraging the advantages of \acr{IRT}, we were able to create two task versions: a standardized version with a fixed number of 89 words, and an adaptive version which reduces the number of words based on the caregiver input while maintaining measurement accuracy. The \acr{PREVIC} shows highly reliable results and convergent validity in a German sample. Up to this day, both tasks, the \acr{oREV} and the \acr{PREVIC}, are available only in German. However, the construction and implementation of the testing infrastructure will ease further adaptions to different languages. Furthermore, the web app platform greatly simplified collected large data sets (\acr{oREV}: *N* = 581, \acr{PREVIC}: *N* = 1190) which is essential for an \acr{IRT}-based task construction.

The web-app implementation might tackle another challenge of child research: Developmental studies often report high number of drop-out rates, for example because of children's fuzziness, fatigue or lack of motivation [@slaughter2007participant]. Administering the \acr{TANGO} has proven very helpful in this regard: across communities, children tended to complete the task with ease and joy, and often even asked for a repetition. Not only did this allow for a large number of trials per child, but it also meant that drop-out rates could be greatly reduced.

@allen2024using have recently promoted games as intuitive, rewarding, engineered research environments. The authors have argued that online games enable studying various domains of cognition with the potential of higher ecological validity, increased participant diversity, cross-cultural suitability and adaptability, and large-scale data sets. Our self-made, game-like design of the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) leverages these advantages while retaining maximum experimental control.

Furthermore, the task design enabled a large-scale cross-cultural data collection. Adopting study designs for cross-cultural research is often time-consuming. The modular structure of the \acr{TANGO—CC} eases this process by providing customizable building blocks. Task instructions are embedded as pre-recorded audio files. This way, the training of the experimenters can be streamlined and there is little room for error by the experimenters. Without these features, we could not have collected data of more than a thousand children across five different continents within a time frame of 22 months.

We want to highlight the diversity of the \acr{TANGO—CC} data set from [Study III](#studyIII). Participants lived in various kinds of social, cultural, political, and ecological systems, using different languages and subsistence styles. Previous cross-cultural research has often focused on comparing communities from the urban Global North to communities from the rural Global South [@barrett2020cognitive]. We overcame this common pitfall of a dichotomous comparison by providing a more complete, more inclusive picture of the different environments in which children grow up.

## Limitations {#limitations}

While the studies included in this dissertation have shown their strengths and unique research contributions, they need to be considered against some limitations.

First of all, I want to draw attention to the modification in terminology. While [Study I](#studyI) has stated that the \acr{TANGO} measures *gaze understanding*, we have switched to the term *gaze following* in [Study II](#studyII), [Study III](#studyIII), and [Study IV](#studyIV). We have defined gaze understanding as "the ability to locate and use the attentional focus of an agent" [@prein2024tango, p. 2471], and gaze following as "turning one’s eyes in the same direction as the gaze of another agent" [@prein2024tango, p. 2471] or as "the ability to identify the attentional focus of another agent" [@prein2024measuring, p. 9]. In [Study I](#studyI), we have argued that the \acr{TANGO}'s pre-requisite is gaze following and that it not only includes this component but also an action toward the gazed-at location (*i.e.,* clicking at the target location) which would resemble real-life situations in which we apply social information to advise our own behavior. However, a reviewer of [Study II](#studyII) questioned whether the term "gaze understanding" appropriately captures the construct that the \acr{TANGO} measures. They argued that the \acr{TANGO} mainly involves estimating gaze directions, and the cognitive and perceptual underpinnings remain unclear. The phrase "understanding" might overestimate children's ability and might imply a more representational processing than is actually needed for or measured by the task itself. Consequently, we have adopted the term gaze following, which is more consistent with the existing literature and does not suggest any representational processing or conceptual understanding.

Regarding the task design, it might be questioned whether the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) is "social enough": stimuli are presented on a screen and participants do not actively engage in a participatory social interaction. We may process social information differently when we interact directly with others than when we simply observe them [@schilbach2013secondperson]. Yet, we could provide first evidence that the \acr{TANGO} taps into real-life social cognition. Children's perspective-taking abilities were related to imprecision in the \acr{TANGO} but less so to a matched, non-social vector following task. Additionally, the relationship to family-level demographics (e.g., age of childcare entry) suggests that the \acr{TANGO} captures a social aspect of children's development.

The proposed cognitive model of gaze following estimates an inference parameter that describes participants' uncertainty around the true pupil angles. While the model gained substantial evidence, the risk of oversimplification exists: potentially, we have missed other parameters that comprise gaze following or explain the performance in the \acr{TANGO}. For example, a motor noise parameter could be helpful to model how accurately participants click on the location that they wanted to click. In addition, the conducted model comparions (against a center bias and random guessing) might profit from more complex alternative models. We have suggested a line-of-sight approach with and without motor noise in the Supplementary materials of [Study II](#studyII). While these can explain how participants solve the \acr{TANGO}, they do not model individual differences in participants' inferential abilities and do not recover the U-shaped pattern as predicted by the gaze model and as found in the data. Competitive, realistic alternative models to our gaze model remain to be established. Finally, the proposed gaze model cannot explain whether the development of increasingly precise gaze following (*i.e.*, the decrease in imprecision in the task performance, and the decrease in uncertainty around the pupil angles in the model) appears due to physical, cognitive, or emotional changes. Physical changes might include a maturation in visual acuity (though unlikely for pre-school children), cognitive changes might include a greater sensitivity to social information or an increased comprehension that eye gaze can be used as a cue, and emotional changes might include a higher motivation to focus on other agents as children get older. These and many other factors could drive the refinement of gaze following precision and are mutually compatible with the proposed gaze model.

The \acr{TANGO—CC} was designed with constant input of local collaborators. Nevertheless, the original brainstorming, organization and implementation process was mainly based in Leipzig, Germany. Cross-cultural research would benefit from even more community-based, participatory, decolonized methods development throughout all stages of the research process [@bermudez2016decolonizing; @grant2022decolonizing; @stanton2014crossing].

The \acr{TANGO—CC} has shown technology effects; that is, children with no prior touchscreen access showed slightly larger imprecision levels. This remains important when applying the \acr{TANGO—CC} and interpreting the results across communities. Noticeably, communities in which all children had access to touchscreens still showed individual differences. This underlines that not all variation can be attributed to different levels of technology exposure. Additional variables that could predict children's performance in the \acr{TANGO—CC} need to be examined.

One criticism of the studies included in this dissertation might be the strong methodological focus, while theory development or testing was less prominent. First, I believe that a considerable time and effort was required for the "sanity checks" and the assessment of reliability and generalizability of the \acr{TANGO}(—CC), so that now the theory testing can start. Second, as have been shown in the [Theoretical Contributions](#theoreticalcontributions), we could already tackle some of the open research questions around the topic of gaze following. Third, there remain many more interesting research questions that would benefit from an individual differences measure of gaze following. In the following section, I will highlight some potential future research avenues.

## Outlook

### Possible spin-offs of the TANGO

The modular structure of the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) enables swift modifications of the stimuli and experimental design. Here, I provide first ideas how to apply, modify and extend the task to answer new research questions around gaze following or other related constructs.

The cognitive model of gaze following (see [Study II](#studyII)) assumes that participants integrate information of the agent's left and right eye to estimate their attentional focus. Potentially, integrating the information is especially important for the more challenging target locations to the sides. The \acr{TANGO}(—CC) could easily be adapted to test this claim. For example, the agent could be modified into a playful, alien-like appearance which would make it possible to vary the number of eyes (e.g., one vs. three eyes). This setup could help to disentangle on which pupils the participants rely on to estimate the focus of attention.

Another assumption of the gaze model is that participants show a bias towards the screen center. We could explore which components leads to this center bias by creating new starting scenes in the \acr{TANGO}(—CC). The position of the agent and the starting point of the balloon could be varied. For example, the agent could be positioned on the very left- or right-hand side of the scene. Furthermore, we could modify the direction of the balloon's trajectory. So far, the balloon's final position varies on the horizontal plane. We could estimate whether difficulties vary when the balloon varies on the vertical plane.

Most importantly, the current version of the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) results in different distances for different target positions: the very far left and right target positions yield the longest balloon trajectories. Together with the characteristics of distributions in the gaze model, this results in the prediction that participants show greater imprecision in trials where the balloon lands sideways. An alternative setup could employ a circle-based design (G. Gredebäck, personal communication, July 14, 2022). Imagine a clock. The agent and balloon starting position would be in its center. This time, however, the balloon would fly in all possible directions like watch hands pointing at the 12 different hours. Importantly, the movement radius of the balloon would stay the same so that it always covers the same distance. This alternative design could circumvent the potential diffusion between participant precision and balloon distance.

Initially, we developed two task versions of the \acr{TANGO}, with one discrete and one continuous outcome measure (see [Study I](#studyI)). The studies that followed (see [Study II](#studyII), [Study III](#studyIII), and [Study IV](#studyIV)) all relied on the continuous task version. While the continuous version of the task shows slightly better psychometric properties (especially with regards to internal consistency, see [Study I](#studyI)), the discrete version of the \acr{TANGO} might be more helpful for some research questions. First, it is noteworthy that the task difficulty can be easily adjusted by varying the number of boxes between two and eight. With some additional programming efforts, the box version could be turned into an adaptive testing setup: participants could start with a small number of boxes and once they succeed in a given trial, the difficulty is adjusted and more boxes are shown. This might be helpful for implementing a training intervention or studying children's learning curves in gaze following. Second, the boxes in the discrete version could be modified into different colors or forefronts. The appearance of the boxes could be matched to some feature of the agent: a monkey and a box with a banana sticker in the front, or a girl wearing blue shorts and t-shirt with a blue box. Phenomena such as group identity, prior knowledge, or diverse desires could be studied in this way.

In the [Limitations section](#limitations) I have discussed whether the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) is "social enough". One idea to increase the social context of the task is to recreate a prior social interaction between the participant and the agent on screen. In a brief spin-off attempt (\mbox{\url{https://github.com/ccp-eva/gafo-cc/tree/playground}}), I have created a task in which the participant can guide where the agent looks: The participant can click on any location on the screen and the agent then gazes at exactly this location. While this certainly remains an interaction on screen, it does enhance the second-person perspective and may underline the shared intentionality between the agent and the participant.

Lastly, a touchscreen familiarization could be completed before participants start the \acr{TANGO}(—CC). This might be especially helpful for participants with no or little technology exposure (see [Study III](#studyIII)). One idea would be to implement a bubble wrap game in which participants can crush little air pockets (or even balloons) by quickly clicking on them. This design could accustom participants to be precise, determined, motivated and quick in their touchscreen responses.

### Open research questions

The \acr{TANGO} allowed us to employ the same study design from early childhood into late adulthood, which eases a direct quantitative comparison of the data. Yet, applying the same study design does not necessarily entail that it captures the same underlying constructs in all age groups. Longitudinal or developmental measurement invariance means that a task validly measures the target phenomenon at different ages, so that it is both valid at each age and comparable across ages [@skinner2019developmental]. Factors like familiarity with the data collection method or stimuli might influence participants' performance in a task (cf. effect of touchscreen experience in [Study III](#studyIII)). While the developmental trajectory found in [Study II](#studyII) suggests that participants with older age had no issues completing the \acr{TANGO}, future studies should further investigate its longitudinal/developmental measure invariance [@petersen2023reexamining]. Most importantly, future research could employ the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) in a longitudinal study design to investigate how children develop and refine their gaze following abilities throughout their childhood. Combining such efforts with the collection of demographic variables and other (social-) cognitive abilities would result in an even more fine-grained understanding of helping and hindering factors in this development.

Our proposed gaze model established a process-level theory of how people estimate another agent's point of attention. What it does not include is a theory on the emergence of gaze following in the first place. It remains unclear which mechanisms drive children to start following eye gaze [@astor2022gaze]. Existing theories place different emphasis on children's innate abilities, their social awareness and motivation, or their propensity for reinforced learning. [TODO refs] Testing these theories against each other and disentangling potential driving forces in the development of gaze following remains an interesting open research avenue.

So far, we have relied on an active behavioral measure. Future research could apply eye tracking with the \acr{TANGO}(—CC). This would have several advantages. First, by moving away from an active behavioral choice, younger infants could be included. This would complete the lifespan perspective from [Study II](#studyII) and enable testing the cognitive gaze model for this age group. Second, we could compare touch and gaze behavior. This might be especially interesting for children who are imprecise in their touch behavior. Do these children look exactly where the agent is gazing and are just imprecise in their touch behavior? Or do they rather already look imprecisely and touch exactly at where they themselves have followed the agent's gaze to? The interplay or match between looking and touching behavior might prove helpful in identifying the sources of errors, which — in turn — would be very informative for the computational modeling work. [todo refs?]

We have seen that, often, developmental theories assume that social interactions shape social-cognitive abilities. In [Study I](#studyI), we found suggestive evidence that opportunities to interact socially correspond to higher precision levels in gaze following. However, this claim needs further empirical justification. Most importantly, we need good measures on both ends: for the social-cognitive abilities in question but also for children's daily social interactions. The parental questionnaire applied in [Study I](#studyI) could only serve as a rough proxy for children's daily interactions. What is needed are more fine-grained tools to capture children's lived experiences. Modern machine learning and computer vision advancements seem to be a promising avenue in this regard. [todo refs] Furthermore, we could not replicate the relationship between gaze following and the number of siblings in the cross-cultural sample (see [Study III](#studyIII)). Cross-culturally assessing these family-level variables in more detail could help to settle this research question.

The relationships between gaze following precision and language abilities, non-social vector following, and perspective taking were only assessed in a sample from the Global North (Leipzig, Germany). We cannot generalize these findings to hold true across cultures and languages. Future research could investigate said relationships in more diverse communities.

To come back to the [Introduction](#introduction), we could further assess the claim that social-cognitive abilities define what makes us uniquely human. Existing research has shown that great apes (and other mammals) can follow gaze of another agent [todo ref]. However, the experimental setups often included synchronous head and eye movement and a dichotomous object choice. To circumvent these issues, the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) could be adjusted for comparative use: how would non-human great apes (e.g., chimpanzees and bonobos) perform in this gaze following task? Studies could either rely on tracking the eye gaze of the apes or rely on the touchscreen format. Many of the chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center in Leipzig, Germany, have gained experience with participating in touchscreen studies [@allritz2021chimpanzees; @close2015colour; @margiotoudi2019sound; @munar2015common]. 

While the studies included in this dissertation focus on social cognition and gaze following, we also invented a new continous measure to non-social vector following abilities (see [Study II](#studyII)). Having this task at hand, we could answer whether vector estimation is needed in other social-cognitive abilities. For example, predicting an action of another agent (e.g., pointing or reaching for a cup) might rely on estimating vectors in space [@omadagain2019origin]. Some scholars might question whether abilities can still be considered social cognition if they rely on physical cognition. I would argue that most (if not all) social-cognitive abilities comprise skills from other domains. For example, consider the classical \acr{FB} Sally-Anne change-of-location task. Here, participants need a certain level of object permanence (*i.e.,* understanding that the ball continues to exist in the box even when it cannot be seen) and causality understanding (*i.e.*, moving a ball has consequences for where it is located) to pass the task. Studying which additional social- and non-social cognitive abilities are needed to develop the social-cognitive ability in question (e.g., gaze following) will help us to disentangle the (inter) independence of our core cognitive processes.

The \acr{TANGO}(—CC) focuses on the detection of gaze direction and as such, more on the participant's passive role as a gaze observer and the information-acquiring and -processing perspective. However, eye gaze has been said to fulfill many different functions in social interactions: eye gaze might signal a warning, a communicative intention or an emotional state [e.g., @argyle1973different]. Recent research by @gerlofs2022eye has started to look into the communicative component of gaze by studying adults' looking behavior during a hide-and-seek game. Future research could investigate the developmental origins of the different gaze functions and how children decide how to direct their own gaze.

Computational cognitive modeling might prove helpful in understanding more complex social-cognitive abilities. For instance, another interesting developing ability in children is to distinguish different knowledge states. A classical test of understanding knowledge access comes from @wellman2001metaanalysis: here, children see the content of a box and need to judge whether another ignorant agent knows what is in the box. Similar to the Sally-Anne \acr{FB} task, the outcome variable is dichotomous and does not leave much room for measuring children's increasingly fine-grained social cognition. In a preliminary pilot study, we have begun to implement a continuous outcome measure that captures children's sensitivity to gradual knowledge states (\acr{DISKO}; \mbox{\url{https://github.com/ccp-eva/disko}}). Children witness how an agent walks with her pet into a hut. They walk along one out of several paths that are built like a decision tree. Familiarization trials show children that the agent and the pet always want to reach the same hut. In the test trials, the agent witnesses differing amounts of the pathway that her pet is walking. For example, the agent sees her pet taking the very first turn to the left, but then a telephone rings and the agent has to leave. The pet continues to walk the way into one of the huts. The agent returns and children are asked to predict to which hut the agent will go. They can distribute sticker across all options. For children that show knowledge—ignorance understanding, they should vary their sticker distribution so that it matches the epistemic state of the agent (*i.e.,* placing no sticker on huts that the agent can exclude as her pet’s location; and equally placing sticker on the huts where her pet could be). As such, the \acr{DISKO} should measure children's action prediction in situations where the agent has gradually varying knowledge access. A potential computational cognitive model could involve two model parameters: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. The parameter $\beta_1$ would capture children's sensitivity to differences in knowledge states based on differential perceptual input, and the parameter $\beta_2$ would capture how much children get biased or distorted by reality (*i.e.*, action prediction based on the agent’s belief or the world state as in the pet's actual location). The gaze model proposed in [Study II](#studyII) could potentially serve as one of the components that make up $\beta_1$. This proposed study idea highlights (at least) two new research aims. First, it highlights how new study designs could capture social cognition in a more continuous, fine-grained manner so that individual differences can be captured. Second, it underlines the appeal of modeling social cognition. Cognitive models could build up on each other and break down which components are needed to master a certain ability [@baker2017rational]. Potentially, we could assess whether gaze following is, indeed, a fundament for other social-cognitive abilities.

## Conclusion

In this dissertation, I have shed new light on the variation in gaze following across individuals, ages, and communities. I have questioned the traditional perspective of interpreting individual differences as measurement error or noise, and have shown the added value of assessing said variation in a given social-cognitive ability. The studies included in this dissertation have reported the development, psychometric assessment, and application of a new task to measure individual differences in gaze following. The extensive evaluation of the \acr{TANGO} and the \acr{TANGO—CC}, respectively, constitutes an exception in the field of social-cognitive studies. Administering the \acr{TANGO}(—CC) has enabled us to gain a comprehensive, multi-perspective view on gaze following and decipher the universal cognitive processes behind it. A computational cognitive model showed that children and adults follow gaze by estimating pupil angles and, consequently, gaze vectors that run from the center of the eye through the pupil. As this is a noisy inference process, individuals are assumed to vary in their uncertainty around this pupil angle, which leads to behavioral differences. The development in gaze following corresponds to a reduction in uncertainty. The proposed gaze model could describe children's gaze following in 17 diverse communities worldwide, which speaks for a potentially universal cognitive process in estimating gaze directions. Furthermore, gaze following related to children's receptive vocabulary, proxies of social interaction opportunities, non-social vector following and perspective-taking abilities (in a German child sample). In sum, this dissertation illustrates how combining reliable tasks, formal theoretical models, and cross-cultural research enables us to study the development and mechanisms of social cognition — precisely those abilities that make us uniquely human.
